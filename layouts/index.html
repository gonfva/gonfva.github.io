      <p class="pic-left">I have more than 20 years of experience in Information Technology 
        wearing many different hats: from purely technical as an engineer, 
        to more product or people based, including requirements gathering, 
        team leading and mentoring. I have worked for many different 
        organisations: from NGO and startups to big international corporations 
        in regulated environments and Government agencies. 
        I try to stay abreast both in the technical field and in the business 
        and innovation arena and I can prove that I'm able to quickly master 
        very different technologies and make things work.</p>

      <p>In the last few years I’ve been getting a focus in architecture 
        and cloud and I got an AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification (now expired).</p>
      
      <p>My core strength is my ability to innovate 
        and provide “off-the-beaten-track” solutions. I have a very strong 
        personal sense of service. As evidence of that, I have twice been asked 
        by former employers to collaborate with them once more, years after resigning.</p>
