      A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.
AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public accessWhen I read the initial reports, I thought the root cause was the usual “S3 bucket with public permissions” (S3 is a distributed object storage in AWS). It’s not uncommon that companies that are not very fluent with AWS permissions, end up making public a whole S3 bucket.

      I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.

What follows is just one example I found on the Internet (i.

Most people in the software industry know Jira. For better or for worse, it’s the most used product for managing tickets, requests, bugs…
The company behind that product, Atlassian, has other products. One of them is called Bitbucket, and, similar to Github, it is a Source Code management system. My personal opinion is that Bitbucket is cheaper, but also that Github is better.

      One of the things less obvious for anyone trying to setup Cloudwatch alarms is the treatment of missing points.
You create an alarm, to detect too many 5xx errors in your ELB. But you don’t want it to be triggered too much, so you ask for at least one error per minute during 5 minutes. And you discover that the error gets triggered whenever during the last 5 minutes there was either zero, 2 or more.

      So you are using AWS Elastic Load Balancer in front of a set of Apache httpd servers and you’ve discovered that your Apache logs are full of garbage. Here comes a set of tips to improve your logging:
 Put a specific endpoint for the health check and don’t log it. ELB needs to check if the endpoint is up and running, so it needs to periodically check an endpoint. By default, all those calls get logged, so better to filter them out.

Sony Xperia U (ST25i) has a stock Android 2.3, which a year ago was already a bit old.

      [Long post] Edited (08th-Jun-2014): Updated the firmware download site. In my previous post I explained that one of the things that made the installing process more difficult was the lack of a general picture of the process. There are lots of pages explaining recipes to install, but I find it difficult to follow recipes if I don't manage to understand the underlying logic. The following is my visualization of the whole process (this is less than a week of knowledge, so I cannot say I'm an expert: take it with a grain of salt).

      I have been fighting with PHP, Mantis and SOAP since my last post. Now I think I have discovered a bug when uploading via Mantis SOAP a binary file. It's great being able to debug a PHP application. I hope what I discovered is useful for more people. But I've discovered something quite shocking: I wasn't able to find any good answers to something that must be frequent. I was uploading a binary file sending nulls: 00 00 00 or when base64-encoded: AAAA (in hex 41 41 41 41).

       Activate log4j. Without it you're lostLook through the log to see if you're getting the RequestMapping through Spring.If you are not despite correct annotations, see this post. In particular if you've got Spring Security installed, for Goodness sake, don't forget these lines:&lt;beans:bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping"&gt;
&lt;beans:bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter"&gt;
&lt;/beans:bean&gt;&lt;/beans:bean&gt;
Just in case you decided to change the mappings, and you continue to see the old ones in the logs, clean and rebuild.

      These days I'm getting very proud of myself. I'm acting less as a project manager and more as a true Scrum Manager. I go to the scrum, listen, and a great deal of my work that day is trying to solve problems for the team. That's great because in order to remove the glitches of my team I have to learn a lot on very different topics.
One of those topics has been Xerces and Xalan.

      I said in the previous post that Xalan and Xerces sometimes look like magic. So what are they and why are so complicated?. Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents. You can parse XML documents in different ways. You can transform into a memory structure, building a big object, or you can even parse only the elements you need. There's a whole array of ways to manage XML documents and schemas, and Xerces helps with them.

      In my previous entry, I tried to explain why Xerces and Xalan are so complicated. In this entry I want to focus in System.setProperty. Because, as I said that is the usual solution you are going to find when you need a specific parser for whatever reason. And that solution is wrong. Very wrong. Because, if you choose to change the provider using System.setProperty, you are changing the provider for all the applications in the container/server.

I was developing a feature that allows to export from my showcase project Whendoigo to TripIt.&nbsp;
I was using a gem from TripIt. A gem is kind of a library for Ruby (sort of jar for Java). The gem simply encapsulated the API from TripIt. But it was failing and apparently everything on my project was correct. So this time it didn't took me too long to start debugging the actual gem's code.

      OK. I have explained why Xerces and Xalan are a source of problems, and I have explained why you shouldn't use System.setProperty to resolve them. In this post I wan't to give a few recipes to resolve Xerces and Xalan problems. Under no circumstances use System.setProperty anywhere in your application. I know I have already dedicated a post, but I wanted to stress it once more. Sometimes you'll need some specific parser (OC4J had a strange bug that needed a specific parser, and Weblogic seems to have special needs too).

      In a previous post I proposed some tips for trying to manage and control the hell of XML and XPATH parsers. However, as&nbsp;one reader pointed, those tips sometimes are not enough. What Simon explained may not seem obvious, but sadly for us (I came across a different problem with the same underlying cause), it is.

In my previous post I explained how to make Java choose a class for a parser.
