          <article class="post__content">
              
<p>You’ve probably seen the video presentation about Google Duplex, the new assistant created by <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/google" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Google</a> that can make phone calls that sound totally human interactions to the human on the other side (and to anyone listening).</p>
<p>If you haven’t, please go watch the 4 minutes version.</p>
<p>You can read more about it in <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>this article</a>. Not sure how this will work in real life.</p>
<p>But the demo looks <strong>amazing</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="the-controversy">The controversy</h4>
<p>Honestly, I arrived to the presentation and discovered Google Duplex from the controversy in <a href="https://hackernoon.com/tagged/twitter" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Twitter</a>. And then I watched the video.</p>
<p>And at first, I didn’t even understand the problem people was having with it. (I’m not even sure I have fully understand it).</p>
<p>People demanded that Google Duplex should identify itself as a robot when speaking with a human. But why? I couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>One of the issues was that Google had also announced that it’s going to call to get the opening hours of business in a massive way. Honestly, I didn’t perceive that to be a big issue. Monthly/weekly call to get opening hours? Is that so much an issue?</p>
<p>So I tried to think more in terms of pros and cons. And I ended up perceiving multiple issues that are being mixed here.</p>
<h4 id="but-first-things-first">But first things first</h4>
<p>I think it is worth mentioning.</p>
<p>We’re taking Google’s presentation at first value. We still don’t know how good it works in real life, just a few demos.</p>
<p>Impressive demos.</p>
<p>But demos.</p>
<h4 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h4>
<p>I think it is worth pointing out the good things that Google Duplex brings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good for the user. Ever since Alexa came out, there was the perception that it was useful, but not quite. Google Duplex promises to change the field.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/benedictevans/status/822961461559324672?lang=en" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
></a>Disclaimer: he sees danger in Google Duplex, though* However, from a local business perspective, this may be a win too. We tend to think every local service has a web page with opening hours and every restaurant or hairdresser has a booking system. But that’s not the case and in some cases it never will be. Google is effectively providing a solution that works for those businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>From a technology perspective, a phone call that is indistinguishable from a human is amazing. And from my perspective an instance of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Turing test</a> passed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risks">Risks</h4>
<p>On the cons, part, I perceive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denial of service</strong>. <em>“If booking is easy, business may end up having loads of appointments that are later cancellation or no-show”</em>. That’s a risk. But it is a risk that is not new. Hotels demand a credit card for making a reservation on the phone. Some restaurants don’t allow bookings in busy days at all or if not in person or if they don’t know the client.</li>
<li><strong>Monopoly</strong>. “<em>Google is a monopoly and it’s going to be a bigger monopoly”</em>. I won’t be the first to say that if monopolies are based on incredible service and not bullies and cronies, they may have value for society.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud and abuse</strong>. <em>“Google has the technology to true natural language processing today. Some time in the future, many others may have it. That opens the path to fraud in massive scale”</em>. Again, a risk that is not new. I don’t take calls I’m not expecting from phones I don’t know. Not when I was living in Spain (they used to be offering the latest broadband deal) nor since I’ve been leaving in the UK (tired of recruiters or to explain I haven’t been involved in an accident). There is nothing new in the call coming from a human or an android (not the OS :D )</li>
<li><strong>Visceral reaction</strong>. “The scary <em>us vs them</em>. The <em>evil super-intelligence is here”</em>. I’ll leave a discussion on this (and the self-identification part) for a future article. I think this is the relevant part but I perceive it is not always clear.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technology-solutions">Technology solutions</h4>
<p>Yes, yes. I know not everything can be solved with technology. But I’m an engineer and I cannot avoid trying.</p>
<p>I remember the first thing I thought when I saw the first steps of the controversy (denial of service).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s build a solution. I will create an IVR using Twilio that would say aloud opening times, and offer some options.Until I understand that <a href="#3b65" 
  
  
>those systems already exists</a>. And if small business don’t have it, they wouldn’t buy my solution either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But my idea “in a few years there will be human-like conversations with only androids involved”, is not original at all. In the LOL camp:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Javi/status/994624094715891713" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
></a>Machines talking to machines is not the only technical solution. For the denial of service with cancellations and no-show, here is my pitch:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cryptocurrency based appointment system. Token exchangeable for mobile credit and returned if client shows as promised.I’m launching an ICO. Do you want some coins? :D</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>Google Duplex seems amazing from a tech point of view.</p>
<p>Yes, there are risks, but in my opinion, they’re not new.</p>
<p>There is also the perception that Artificial General Intelligence may be possible much sooner than we expected.</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong>: I decided to write this article when I got to this</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/995057583445557248"

>Marc Andreessen</a> is brilliant. He may have controversial opinions. I don’t always agree with some of those opinions. <a href="https://medium.com/u/78c5166b8328" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Benedict Evans</a> is a similar case. But I always try to understand because they <strong>always</strong> provide something I hadn’t thought about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marc stopped tweeting after one of those controversies and the rage and fury (as opposed to discussion) that followed.</p>
<p>Now it seems he cannot even like tweets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should be able to exchange opinions.</p>
</blockquote>
