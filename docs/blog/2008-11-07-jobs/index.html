<p>Sometimes I read a couple of posts not directly related, and I start to think
about a topic I didn&rsquo;t expected.</p>
<p>This time, it all started with a post of Enrique Dans.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.enriquedans.com/2008/11/redes-sociales-profesionales-%C2%BFsabe-tu-empresa-que-te-quieres-ir.html"

>Enrique asked what happens when your company is looking for new employees</a>, enters a professional social network like Linkedin to find the right person
for the job, and discover that you have a completely updated profile, showing
that in a way you’re &ldquo;in the market&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Enrique&rsquo;s post is very interesting as whole, but I kept thinking about what
Enrique calls &ldquo;the switchers&rdquo;: people who change from one work to another, and
then to another, always looking for a better salary. And then I remember another
tactic used by some of my coworkers: coming to my boss, telling him that he/she
had and offer from another company and they were leaving, and getting a better
salary for not leaving.</p>
<p>For me, jobs are more than salary, but I always thought it was a bad game for
the companies, as they were rewarding the people less faithful.</p>
<p>I think it would be better to pay your employees what you think you can AND
should pay. Trying to &ldquo;retain talent&rdquo; before &ldquo;talent&rdquo; is even concious he/she
can leave, or before he/she is wanting to leave.</p>
<p>Those were my thoughts when turned up
<a href="https://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/the-9010-rule-o.html" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Seth Godin</a> writing a key thought</p>
<p>If talent is so important that you are betting the company on it, why aren&rsquo;t
you actually investing in finding and retaining that talent?</p>
<p>May I ask you to read it again?</p>
<p>Ten years ago, job offers came in many cases mouth to ear or from the newspaper.
And a new employee was very similar to another new employee. Sort of meat at a
butcher&rsquo;s. There were also headhunter but they were very expensive and for key
positions.</p>
<p>Today it <strong>seems</strong> to be the same. But now
the game is different. Seth was telling it to the employers, but it could be
aplied to the employees.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s different because you create your own reputation, without being
unfaithful to your current employer. Not only by building a network in Linkedin.
But also for answering questions in a forum, or for writing posts in a blog like
this.</p>
<p>In fact, sometimes you&rsquo;re being paid (in a way) for building that reputation. I
love this post:
<a href="http://google.dirson.com/post/3076-cuanto-pagarias-matt-cutts/" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>How much will you pay for Matt Cuts?</a></p>
<p>I know that many companies explore our online profiles. And I think that as
employees we should be concious of our profiles, whether or not we&rsquo;re looking
for a new job. But I don&rsquo;t think that is dishonest or unfaithful. Of course I do
write this blog and I have a relatevely updated Linkedin profile.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ve read too much about <a href="http://www.marcapropia.net/blog.html" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>personal branding</a>.
But it
seems to me that Internet is starting to balance the relationship between
employees and companies.</p>
