              <p>
                A couple of months ago I started working for a different
                company. I&rsquo;m quite happy there for many reasons. But one
                of them is having the opportunity to learn a new language:
                Scala. It&rsquo;s uncommon to get a programming job when you
                don&rsquo;t know the syntax of the programming language used.
                But if you really think about it, it&rsquo;s much better to hire
                somebody passionate about technology and that really loves to
                learn (and commit) than somebody that knows the language but
                doesn&rsquo;t give a d***mn. Anyway, after a couple of months, I
                thought it would be good to write my experience about the
                language. First. What is Scala?
                <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a programming
                language that allows to develop both Object Oriented Programming
                and Functional programming. Functional programming is a new
                paradigm of developing that is opposed to Imperative
                programming. In a nutshell, imagine SQL, the language for
                querying databases. When writing a query you don&rsquo;t write
                code like &ldquo;Take the first row, check if satisfies the
                WHERE clause, if it does, append to the list of results, take
                the following row&hellip;&rdquo;. You simply specify the
                criteria for the results and that&rsquo;s it. But that way of
                querying with SQL that it&rsquo;s inside of almost every
                developer&rsquo;s brain, involves a new way of thinking about
                problems for things that are not database queries. And, believe
                me, it takes time to learn. To the point that today, a couple of
                months later, and
                <a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-004"
                  >halfway a course</a
                >
                devoted to it, I keep writing imperative instead of Functional
                code. One could ask &ldquo;if it is that complicated, why
                bother?&rdquo;.
                <a
                  href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/multithreading-warning-lights.html"
                  >Multithreading is tricky</a
                >, but CPUs have stopped increasing speed and they are
                increasing number of cores, which implies concurrency.
                Functional programming promises to help in that process. And in
                fact, one the emerging libraries in the Java field, the
                <a href="http://akka.io/">akka library</a>, comes from the Scala
                world. The famous lambda in Java 8 is functional programming.
                Regarding the specific language (not the functional paradigm), I
                have mixed feelings. I find it brilliant sometimes. And others I
                see it weird. As an example, I love the tuple concept (the
                ability for a function to return a couple of values at the same
                time without defining a class for that). But I almost scream
                each time I have to refer to the first element of the tuple with
                an _1 (<a
                  href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6241464/why-are-the-indexes-of-scala-tuples-1-based"
                  >as opposed to the typical _0</a
                >). I remember loving Ruby and Rails almost in any line of code.
                Everything felt natural and although in retrospective there were
                weird things, my general feeling was that code flows. With Scala
                I&rsquo;m just starting to feel productive. With Scala love
                appears, but it tends to be in &ldquo;this is freaking
                awesome&rdquo; moments from time to time. [OMG, love and code.
                I&rsquo;m really a nerd, isn&rsquo;t it?] Don&rsquo;t get me
                wrong. Once you get the hang of Scala, it is much much much
                better than Java. It has a strong typing system like java, but
                with type inference that allows to skip types in some
                declarations. It tends to be concise (sometimes to the extreme).
                In its origin, Scala allowed to generate code both for the JVM
                and .NET runtime environments. I suspect that&rsquo;s no longer
                the case and nobody develops in Scala using the .NET. One thing
                I find mind blowing (for bad and for good) is implicits.
                Implicits allow a type to be considered as a different one,
                upgrading the type to a different one. That is very powerful
                because the implicit mechanism relies in transforming functions
                (instead of inheritance or casting). Believe me when I say it is
                brilliant. But sometimes it leaves you scratching your head
                thinking why your code does not work until you remember to
                import the proper implicit conversion function. The editor would
                need a post on its own. There is an
                <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">Eclipse version for Scala</a>.
                But until last Monday, I wasn&rsquo;t able to do automatic
                indentation without risking to mangle my code. Refactoring is
                for brave. And I&rsquo;m living in nightly updates for
                Scala-IDE. I&rsquo;ve been told that IntelliJ is much better,
                but I&rsquo;m trying to avoid it. Finally, learning a new
                language is not only the language itself, but a whole array of
                technologies around. OK. You learn Scala, and then you need to
                learn a web framework. Play would be the equivalent to the
                latest versions of Spring MVC or even Rails. But I&rsquo;m in a
                love-hate relationship with
                <a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a> (which I find absolutely
                different to anything else except for
                <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>).  And you also
                need an ORM. The typical one would be hibernate in the Java
                world or ActiveRecord for ruby.
                <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick</a> is not the more
                used, but it is really promising. And that&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m
                REALLY happy of being able to learn Scala. And I think it has
                transformed my programming habits for years to come (and it will
                do more if I leave behind the beginner level). To the point that
                <a
                  href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/GuidedTour.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH2-XID_1"
                  >I read val instead of let</a
                >. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure I would use Scala for all kind of
                projects. But certainly I would do for backend mission-critical
                code.
