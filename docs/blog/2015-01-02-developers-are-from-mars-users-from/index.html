<p>From 2008 to 2012, I was the project manager of a project with very special users. The kind of project was in the field of digital signature for the Spanish Government. I was in charge not only of acting as a Product Owner (determine features and priorities), but also provided telephone support (second point of contact, that in fact used to be first). The main group of users where well-educated, high-ranked with lots of responsibility in their own field, but non-technical. There were also personal assistants for the previous group, but it wasn&rsquo;t a different group in terms of behavior towards technology.</p>
<div>I remember that apparently trivial questions could pose a challenge. Many people didn't know what a browser is, let alone there were different ones.&nbsp;</div><div>I remember that digital signature at that time was a challenge (install Java, install a certificate, provide appropriate permissions for an applet). Something would fail, and you didn't know what. You would have to debug the process. The other problem for the users would be speed.&nbsp;</div><div>However, as developers it was difficult not to focus in a different set of features, and not try to improve the existing issues.</div><div>At that time I started to perceive the radically different world-views between developers and users. I started to understand when my mom would get angry of me for keeping 10 open tabs while navigating, or to perceive that the AND/OR boolean logic can be quite tricky for non-techies. But I also became aware that maybe when in 2006 I was acting as part of the client team for an outsourced project, it was not a bad provider what time after time would deliver a different thing from what we (technical guys) where expecting.</div><div>Nowadays, I think communication between users and developers is of great importance. The "I'll tell you want I want when I see it" is not something to be dismissed.&nbsp;</div><div>The [agile approach](http://agilemanifesto.org/) is not a "quick and dirty hack" but a "let's understand what the user is looking for". Apart from helping [managing risk](http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/agile-is-about-managing-risk.html).</div>
