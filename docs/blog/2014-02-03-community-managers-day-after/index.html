<p>Yesterday I followed on Twitter a case where the community manager for a -well known and with very good reputation- Spanish moving company <a href="https://twitter.com/outononet/status/428975133315694592" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>literally screwed up their reputation</a>.</p>
<p>He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag &ldquo;vergonzoso&rdquo; (shameful). IMO, the customer was not insulting and she was not threatening. Just complaining.</p>
<p>Initially I thought about <a href="http://www.abc.es/tecnologia/redes/20131013/abci-media-markt-desfile-201310131846.html" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>yet another tactic to be viral</a>. But the reputation of Gil-Stauffer in Spain is completely different. It&rsquo;s the kind of company you would like for a good, incident-free, priced, removal. Sort of a Zappos for Spanish removals. Or that was my impression, at least. After a bit of researching, it seems the incident is not <a href="https://twitter.com/Politea2012/status/429048697289060352/photo/1" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>something</a> new. But this time the backslash is going to be very tough.</p>
<p>So you&rsquo;re a CEO of a big company and you discover that the technology everybody told you it would help interacting with your clients, has literally destroy your reputation. I&rsquo;m sure the CEO did know about the tactics, but now he/she knows this time is different. What to do?</p>
<p>Some possibilities comes to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore as if nothing had happened. It has worked in the past. And it&rsquo;s tempting. But it&rsquo;s flawed, because social networks are about communicating. And because this time is different. Next tweet on that account is going to be replied by hundreds of people.</li>
<li>Hide it (deleting the tweets). No worth even considering. Everybody has now a capture of the tweets.</li>
<li>Rebuild trust.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my opinion, the only real option in a social networked environment is to rebuild trust.</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to act quickly. Rebuilding trust takes time. But you must start as soon as possible. I imagine the management did know yesterday about the major screw up. But today there is no answer. Which means they don&rsquo;t know how to act. And they&rsquo;re obviously considering the options. But if you don&rsquo;t act quickly, you&rsquo;ll be forced to act later on, but losing the benefits.</li>
<li>Apologize. Clearly. Not only for the specific series of comments but also for not understanding the whole social-network issue. Explain you have learnt -where &ldquo;you&rdquo; means the CEO- that social networks are a different thing you didn&rsquo;t understand. And that you personally are going to learn.</li>
<li>Start listening. There is a customer that has not get a good experience. Change it. Solve her problem. I remember having a <a href="https://gonzalo.f-v.es/blog/2013-07-16-ikea-vs-greenwich/" 
  
  
>bad experience with IKEA that was completely reversed</a> to a great experience thanks to their Customer Relationship department.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social networks are about interacting with your customers and getting feedback. It&rsquo;s about listening.</p>
<p>It is not a new channel to fill with Press Releases or (worse) to threaten clients.</p>
<p>Update: They finally manage to <a href="https://twitter.com/Gil_Stauffer/status/429721421552439296" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>apologize</a> (and also on the <a href="https://twitter.com/Gil_Stauffer/status/429722121724366848" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>general issue</a>). Late.</p>
