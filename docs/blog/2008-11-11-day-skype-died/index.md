I read it first on
[Google Operating System](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/11/voice-and-video-chat-in-gmail.html), but I haven't seen too much buzz on the blogs I follow.

For me today is the day [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) has
definitively died.

[Maybe it was long before](http://www.enriquedans.com/2007/10/%c2%bffue-realmente-un-error-la-compra-de-skype.html)
from a pure bussiness view. There hasn't been anything new since Skype's
adquisition by Ebay. And my contacts on Skype were offline most of the time
lately.

But from now I don't have any reason to even install Skype. Of course, there
were a lot of others programs apart from Skype.

But from today I can open Gmail, and
[chat with video and voice from the browser](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html). And my contacts are already there.

But I think the movement hits further than Skype. I'm afraid
[this is only the begining](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Google/?p=1170).
