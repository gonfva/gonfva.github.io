<p>When I <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/what-is-this.html">started this blog</a>, I had a goal. I needed to practice my English, because I wanted to go abroad. Months (or even years) later, more reasons appeared. First, I discovered that writing about solutions to job related problems could give people a way to solve their own problems more easily. Later on, I realized it could also be a way to show that I wasn&rsquo;t a newcomer while looking for a position abroad. But practicing my English kept being the main reason.
<br /><br />
On 1st November I <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/relocating-to-london.html">came to live to United Kingdom</a>. I got a position for a company in London. I know people in that company read this, and I don&rsquo;t want to look too &ldquo;creep&rdquo;, but the company is not stressful, and people are quite nice and are really trying to make me feel fully integrated. I&rsquo;m not at all there, but once I get over the communication barrier, I feel I will be really part of it.
<br /><br />
So I&rsquo;m living abroad and I don&rsquo;t expect to be looking for a different job in the near/medium term. I should say that some of the original goals are completed.
<br /><br />
However, I do need to keep improving my English. Probably more talking than writing or listening. But also writing and listening. And, because of that, this blog still could have a mission. But I don&rsquo;t know what to write about.
<br /><br />
The most obvious topics could be about my life here in London. Unfortunately, I have started a blog in Spanish to keep my family on the loop.
<br /><br />
Also I fear sometimes I could offend people with my comments.
<br /><br />
A short example. People here tend to ask me about my opinion of London. I used to not answer (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only been here a few weeks dadada&rdquo;). On Monday, a colleague (who wasn&rsquo;t born in the UK, but have been here for long time) asked me the same question, and this time I answered quite honestly. I think is a city focused on living and not in tourism. I mean, I know it has vibrant cultural life, and obviously it has many places to visit. But it is not a &ldquo;charming&rdquo; tourist based city. From his feedback (I&rsquo;m not at all good at receiving non obvious tips in English) I got the impression I don&rsquo;t have a clue, so I played down.
<br /><br />
Apparently <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/offbeat/londons-not-smiles-better-survey-16249848.html">my impression is not so strange</a>, although it probably shouldn&rsquo;t be carved on stone. But you get the idea.
<br /><br />
