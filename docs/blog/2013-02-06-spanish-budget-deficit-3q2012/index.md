From time to time I visit [the page where the internal comptroller in Spain posts its budget deficit figures](http://www.igae.pap.minhap.gob.es/sitios/igae/en-GB/InformesCuentas/Informes/Paginas/publicaciones.aspx). Last week there was a link to the calendar of future publications. The calendar was last updated past September, and didn´t show anything for 2013. Usually at the end of January appears 3rd quarter budget deficit. So when January ended with no new data, I knew the figures would be bad.


And they are terrible.


Take [this document](http://www.igae.pap.minhap.gob.es/sitios/igae/es-ES/InformesCuentas/Informes/Documents/Cap-Trim/3T%20AAPP_2012.pdf), and sum up deficit for the first three quarters of 2012.


13,991+31,176+20,169=65,336


Now take [the data for the GDP](http://www.ine.es/en/daco/daco42/daco4214/tabcntr_en.xls)


258,537+269,169+252,753=780,459


And now get the percentage.


Budget deficit for 3Q2012 was **8.37%**. Down from 8.54% 2Q2012. And a commitment of 6.3% in Q42012


Austerity.


Yes, I know [I wrote central government budget deficit was going great]({{< ref "2012-12-20-spanish-budget-deficit-what-if">}}). I don´t what have happened. Maybe financial institutions help. Probably regional deficit. Who knows.
