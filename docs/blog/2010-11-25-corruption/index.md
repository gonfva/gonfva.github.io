Wow. It seems Wikileaks is going to [publish some documents showing implication of some world leaders in corruption practices](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AN5HL20101124). I don't have any other information but the Reuters piece of news.


I wouldn't have brought it to this blog if it weren't for the last paragraph of the first page:



    Two of the sources said Assange has also made the documents available to at least two other European publications -- the newspapers El Pais of Spain and Le Monde of France.


That would suggest that government leaders implicated could be Spaniards or Frenchmen. Don't know if it's true.


But watching financial markets regarding peripheral European bonds I can't help thinking that this could have connections with Spanish politics.
