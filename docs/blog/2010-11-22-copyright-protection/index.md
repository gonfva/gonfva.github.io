You know something is broken with copyright when:

+ You buy a "Barbie and three Musqueteers" DVD and you can't play in your DVD player because it's piracy protected. **But...** You download the same film from a P2P network, save to a CD and you can play it everywhere.

+ You can't install the Windows Vista that came with your computer, on a VirtualBox over a Linux box, because it refuses to activate. **But...** You can download a file from a P2P network that contains 4 versions of Windows 7 (from starter to ultimate) that will happily install on VirtualBox, will activate and will update flawlessly.


I'm sick of this.
