This afternoon I was preparing an interview I expect to have next week, and came to an interesting [page with information about job selection process and companies inside information](http://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-S-and-P-EI_IE30287.11,18.htm). However, after surfing a bit, the inevitable, "become a registered member" started to bug me.


And I got tired.


And I remembered FT similar "become a registered" and WSJ "first-paragraph-only". Lots of sites show you the page when you come from Google, but ask you to register if you start to surf (or just come from a different page). Completely understandable, but not very pleasant.


So I asked myself if it would be too complicated to build an extension for Google Chrome, that when you are at a page and asks to register, you ask google to get redirected to that page. It seems it's not. I started poking at 19:00 (local development folder creation time was 19:07) and ended building it at 20:30 (icon included). It's pretty basic, but it makes a bit of tweaking with FT and WSJ URLs because just coming from Google was not enough. And now it works, with glassdoor, FT, and WSJ.


Great. I learnt and I have something interesting to show.


In the future.


Maybe showing I'm willing to "hack" a paywall is not something I should be publishing when interviewing for a financial information company. Or maybe yes. Anyway: this is me.


Next post. How I did it.
