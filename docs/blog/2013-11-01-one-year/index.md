A year ago I was in a plane flying into London. I was in whirl, nearly panicking. My life about to change.


I'm somebody who loves being in his comfort zone. And then leaving your wife and daughters for 6 months. Leaving your country for who knows how much time.


It has been hard. There have been difficult times. In lots of different levels. Renting in London (well worth a million pages book). Eating in London (a shorter book :D). Weekend trips back to Spain waking up at 4am on a Saturday and back to London at 3pm on a gloomy Sunday. Talking to your family via Skype. Missing lots of things. Closing down the family home in Madrid and moving to London. Missing the light.


But I don't regret it at all. It is being a wonderful experience. My daughters are happy. My wife is happy. There are lots of great people all around.


And so far, it is working well. There's a new comfort zone around (sort of).


I don't know about the future.


But so far, so good.
