<p>A few months ago I reported <a href="https://gonzalo.f-v.es/blog/2013-08-30-changes/" 
  
  
>my business unit was offered for sale</a>. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)</p>
<p>Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.</p>
<p>I remember in particular one interview. It didn&rsquo;t start well when I replied &ldquo;<a href="http://translate.google.com/#es/en/s%C3%AD" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>Sí,</a> I mean, yes&rdquo; after listening my name with a perfect Spanish z sound (as it turned out, one of the interviewers was Spanish too). It didn&rsquo;t continue well due to my inability to reply to the typical Java interview questions (such as Big-Oh notation complexity for a java hashlist look up or differences between Spring container and JEE container). I didn&rsquo;t pass the test.</p>
<p>But for me as an experience, the interview finished wonderfully when the Spanish guy asked &ldquo;What are you looking for? What&rsquo;s your ideal job?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>I think it is very difficult to match companies and people.</strong></p>
<p>Companies would really like people that could commit to the project and I certainly prefer a company where I feel my work makes a difference. However, companies tend to look for people that can hit the ground running at the lower cost. And developers tend to look for companies with better conditions and more buzzwords.</p>
<p>One could think that model is flawed. But the fact is that the alternative is not always better. In a past life I had to do some recruitment. And the worst selection was a guy I thought he was going to fit perfectly in the culture. And as an interviewee I&rsquo;ve never asked if I would be able to fully manage my own machine or if I would personally know the people managing the servers.</p>
<p>So back again to the interview &ldquo;What are you looking for? What&rsquo;s your ideal job?&rdquo;. Putting in words, I want a place challenging, where I can learn new things and do different tasks day in day out. I want a place where I can commit and where my job makes a difference. I won&rsquo;t talk about my current job except to say people are wonderful. I don&rsquo;t know about the future in my current job. And I&rsquo;m really proud that <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/one-year.html?showComment=1383561713976#c2877416254032399152" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>people still remember me</a> from my previous job. I do remember them too. So people are very important too.</p>
<p>But, the fact is that suddenly, I realized how difficult matching companies with people is. Because I certainly could have answered all those questions, and that wouldn&rsquo;t have made me more suitable for the job (in fact I aced the concurrency ones which I have a more solid knowledge background but less experience). I remember selecting people we used to ask for digital signature experience and hitting the ground running didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with that.</p>
<p>But even if I were an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/13/net-us-siliconvalley-engineers-twitter-idUSBRE99C03R20131013" 
  
   target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" 
>incredibly valued employee</a>, I wouldn&rsquo;t have a clue if the job I was being offered is the one was looking for or if that&rsquo;s my ideal job.</p>
