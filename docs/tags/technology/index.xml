      <description>For many people not living in the UK, it will come as a surprise that the railway system in London is quite expensive and provides a really bad service.
Train service is not a theme park.</description>

      <description>TLDR; VR on macOS means beta, crashes, unusable WebVR, and no games. But you get to learn a lot. This post explains my experience.
It seems this time I’m one of the few non-professionals that has bought an HTC Vive and a Mac after June’s keynote.</description>

      <description>I like Netflix. I really do. But there are a few things in their user interface that drive me crazy.
You cannot remove a movie from continue watching. You’ve already watched a movie, don’t want to see the credits, but Netflix thinks you haven’t reached the end.</description>

      <description>There is a new report that associates Let’s Encrypt with phishing. So lots of people in Twitter started screaming because they read phishing and Paypal in the same sentence.
Let’s Encrypt is a foundation that gives certificates away for free.</description>

      <description>I’m sick and tired of reading articles describing how the banks are going to buy the new players in Fintech.
Yes. It is going to happen. It has already happened. BBVA has already bought Simple and Atom.</description>

      <description>Today I was reading this article about excuses from banks for crap services. Then I got to this sentence:
Consumers need to understand that the balance you see is not necessarily your actual available balance because there are so many moving partsNo.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was using my bank account, taking money out using a debit card. No way to see the operation since the feed only has old/settled operations. Since the available balance was below what I considered safe, I moved back the money using the same card.</description>

A week ago I knew nothing about go. Now, I’ve read the rules but I haven’t played a single game. So I’m left to commentators.</description>

      <description>There is some outrage in Twitter because it has started to implement some changes to its product.
There was a change from stars to likes. I think I prefer stars because it conveys a different meaning: when I read something sad, I cannot click in Like, but I would click in star.</description>

      <description>I’ve been a couple of days in Zaragoza (Spain), participating in Tecnimap 2010 last week. Tecnimap is a conference on IT for the Public Administration in Spain. I had presented a paper about one of the applications I manage: DocelWeb.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I got a new Acer Aspire One A110. It&amp;rsquo;s an Atom N270 with 512 MB RAM and 8GB SSD hard disk and 8.9&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; screen. It came with a personalized version of a Linux distribution called Linpus Lite based in Fedora 8.</description>

      <description>I wrote on the previous post that for a particular combination of search terms, Yahoo seemed to offer better results than Google. I read long time ago that in fact search was turning to be a commodity.</description>

      <description>I like products coming from Google, and I’m usually less critic with Google’s errors than with others’. I use Google search, Gmail, Blogger… I even have a ridiculous financial position on Google (8 shares).</description>

      <description>As I said on my last post, I think that integration of Video and voice chat could be part of a greater strategy. What would be that strategy?
In my opinion it should have two parts.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you realize you&amp;rsquo;ve written a weak post too late. It was my case with yesterday&amp;rsquo;s annotation.
I thought nobody would even read it. But it seems that, because of a trackback at Gmail Blog, I was wrong.</description>

      <description>I read it first on Google Operating System, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen too much buzz on the blogs I follow.
For me today is the day Skype has definitively died.</description>

      <description>I heard about MobuzzTV for the first time long time ago. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch news on TV, (I prefer to read than watch), so much less watch on the Internet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention then.</description>
