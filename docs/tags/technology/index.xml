      <description>LLM-scaffolding A couple of weeks ago, I went to an event about AI and trading. The usual &amp;ldquo;oh yes, AI is great, it is going to change everything.&amp;rdquo; But almost every speaker said something along the lines, &amp;ldquo;but it won&amp;rsquo;t be a chat app.</description>

      <description>Kids-Xowit A couple of months ago I mentioned that I wanted to keep experimenting.&#xA;At that point I had launched Xowit. Xowit is something I want to keep exploring and I have another two updates in the works with natural language discovery, and in-app reading.</description>

      <description>TLDR; VR on macOS means beta, crashes, unusable WebVR, and no games. But you get to learn a lot. This post explains my experience.&#xA;It seems this time I’m one of the few non-professionals that has bought an HTC Vive and a Mac after June’s keynote.</description>

      <description>I like Netflix. I really do. But there are a few things in their user interface that drive me crazy.&#xA;You cannot remove a movie from continue watching. You’ve already watched a movie, don’t want to see the credits, but Netflix thinks you haven’t reached the end.</description>

      <description>There is a new report that associates Let’s Encrypt with phishing. So lots of people in Twitter started screaming because they read phishing and Paypal in the same sentence.&#xA;Let’s Encrypt is a foundation that gives certificates away for free.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was using my bank account, taking money out using a debit card. No way to see the operation since the feed only has old/settled operations. Since the available balance was below what I considered safe, I moved back the money using the same card.</description>

      <description>There is some outrage in Twitter because it has started to implement some changes to its product.&#xA;There was a change from stars to likes. I think I prefer stars because it conveys a different meaning: when I read something sad, I cannot click in Like, but I would click in star.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s widely spread that there has been a security breach in LinkedIn. At least there is a file with passwords in that social network. Even LinkedIn acknowledges it and suggests it will try to alert users whose passwords have been compromised.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been Google fanboy for a long time. I remember the invitation for Gmail I received around mid-2004. Gmail was a revolution. From 50MB mail space at the time, they offered 1000MB (1GB).</description>

      <description>I have a two years old Symbian cell phone and a second generation iTouch. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s enough to explain that until very recently I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay any attention at all to mobiles apps ads.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m learning some technologies. I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to write new, but they&amp;rsquo;re not new. I&amp;rsquo;m learning Ruby on Rails and mobile development. I still have to keep learning Java, and Grails, but I have a project in mind and I wanted to separate clearly from my day to day job, for lots of reasons.</description>

      <description>I’ve been a couple of days in Zaragoza (Spain), participating in Tecnimap 2010 last week. Tecnimap is a conference on IT for the Public Administration in Spain. I had presented a paper about one of the applications I manage: DocelWeb.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I got a new Acer Aspire One A110. It&amp;rsquo;s an Atom N270 with 512 MB RAM and 8GB SSD hard disk and 8.9&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; screen. It came with a personalized version of a Linux distribution called Linpus Lite based in Fedora 8.</description>

      <description>I wrote on the previous post that for a particular combination of search terms, Yahoo seemed to offer better results than Google. I read long time ago that in fact search was turning to be a commodity.</description>

      <description>I like products coming from Google, and I’m usually less critic with Google’s errors than with others’. I use Google search, Gmail, Blogger… I even have a ridiculous financial position on Google (8 shares).</description>

      <description>As I said on my last post, I think that integration of Video and voice chat could be part of a greater strategy. What would be that strategy?&#xA;In my opinion it should have two parts.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you realize you&amp;rsquo;ve written a weak post too late. It was my case with yesterday&amp;rsquo;s annotation.&#xA;I thought nobody would even read it. But it seems that, because of a trackback at Gmail Blog, I was wrong.</description>

      <description>I read it first on Google Operating System, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen too much buzz on the blogs I follow.&#xA;For me today is the day Skype has definitively died.</description>

      <description>I heard about MobuzzTV for the first time long time ago. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch news on TV, (I prefer to read than watch), so much less watch on the Internet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay much attention then.</description>
