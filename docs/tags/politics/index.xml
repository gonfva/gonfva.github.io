      <description>These days I’m reading a fascinating book on Roman History called SPQR . And I’ve discovered Roman History is full of lessons for today’s world.
As a small token, a line from Plautus , a Roman writer, that appeared in some of his books.
 Demophilus wrote this, Plautus barbarised it.As Mary Beard, the author of SPQR, explains, the sentence was a clever challenge.
 For people of Greek origin, it was a way to mock Romans, that didn’t bring anything new.</description>
