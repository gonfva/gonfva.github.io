      <description>Sometimes I read a couple of posts not directly related, and I start to think about a topic I didn&amp;rsquo;t expected.
This time, it all started with a post of Enrique Dans.
Enrique asked what happens when your company is looking for new employees , enters a professional social network like Linkedin to find the right person for the job, and discover that you have a completely updated profile, showing that in a way you’re &amp;ldquo;in the market&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog it’s a difficult task. It’s not nearly as difficult as keeping updating it, of course.
I have started a couple of blogs.
Both are abandoned.
Not a good track.
Will this blog be different? I don’t know if I’ll continue updating this. But I know for sure this blog is different now.
The first difference is that I’m writing it in English. The reason I’m doing it, is because writing in English it’s an exercise for me.</description>
