      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)
Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.</description>

      <description>A year ago I was in a plane flying into London. I was in whirl, nearly panicking. My life about to change.
I&amp;rsquo;m somebody who loves being in his comfort zone.</description>

      <description>A few days ago my company sent out this press release. It seems to be rather unimportant, but for me it means changes.
I work for that specific business unit. I cannot write too much.</description>

      <description>This post started as a way of comparing different ways of managing customer relationships. It ended up as rant, but I&amp;rsquo;m not going to delete it. But I will write another post in the future with some suggestions.</description>

      <description>Today I rented a car for a few hours. I used to drive in Spain, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t driven since I came to London. I wanted to practice in not too stressful conditions before my family comes to visit me.</description>

      <description>In two weeks I will be working in London. I know I was expecting to continue my last post about Spring persistence. I have lots of things to write about the incredible experience of finding a job abroad and relocating.</description>
