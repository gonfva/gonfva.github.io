      <description>Dear recruiter,
Thank you for contacting. At the moment I’m not looking for a job.
Kind regards,
Gonzalo
This is a bit impersonal.
I know. I’m sorry. The alternative is the above email for everyone.
You have some desired technologies under your belt.
Yes, I know.
Are you happy in your current job? Could you consider other roles?
Yes, I’m happy in my current job. Yes I could consider other roles.</description>

      <description>This is a story for my friend C. He didn’t know what was behind this old tweet
  So I did a quick summary but I didn’t do the honours.
 Here goes the detail. I won’t name the company (it’s bigco, a big company here in the UK).
The process started through a friend of mine that had joined BigCo. We had worked together and he wanted to work with me again.</description>

      <description>For the last month or so I’ve been running a small experiment in my Linkedin profile. I had been receiving contacts from recruiters offering roles, and from recruiters offering developers. I’m not quite interested in any of those services. Frankly, the job market for technology is a crazy house. Companies recruiting on readers of “Cracking the coding interview” instead of culture . Recruiters literally spamming or even sometimes harassing. And “candidates” either jumping for salary or just “getting a job”.</description>

      <description>Dear recruiter. Don’t take it personal, but I’m not interested in the role you’re trying to recruit.
I receive lots of messages from recruiters. I get offered to participate in events so that companies can offer me new jobs.
I tend to reply something like:
 Hi , Thank you for your message. However, at the moment I’m not interested in new opportunities. Kind regards, GonzaloI feel this kind of message does not explain the ultimate reason behind my reply.</description>

      <description>Sometimes I read a couple of posts not directly related, and I start to think about a topic I didn&amp;rsquo;t expected.
This time, it all started with a post of Enrique Dans.
Enrique asked what happens when your company is looking for new employees , enters a professional social network like Linkedin to find the right person for the job, and discover that you have a completely updated profile, showing that in a way you’re &amp;ldquo;in the market&amp;rdquo;.</description>
