      <description>For many people not living in the UK, it will come as a surprise that the railway system in London is quite expensive and provides a really bad service.
Train service is not a theme park. It affects people’s livesSome of my Spanish readers will think “surely that cannot be true”. After all, railway was born in the UK. And punctuality is probably one of the words when a Spaniard thinks of British people.</description>

      <description>I enjoy buying books.
I read physical books too.I enjoy starting them.
Honestly, finishing books is more difficult for me. But I’ve been trying to improve on that.
I was very excited when I bought ‘1776&amp;rsquo; by David McCullough. The title is a reference to the year when American Independence was proclaimed. However the book starts narrating in mid 1775 and ends at well into 1777, and it is more about the Rebellion/War for Independence in those years.</description>

      <description>I’ll start sharing a secret.
 I want to launch a business.Yes, I know many people in the tech industry are in the same situation. They’ve got some burning idea to launch or some dream to fulfil. A side-project going on for ages.
 I do have a number of brilliant ideas, at different stages (none of them complete). But most of the time a simply daydream while reading Twitter, or Hacker News.</description>

      <description>When I was child, I used to play chess. From time to time you would find somebody that just had learned a special kind of opening and had decided to practice no matter what.
But having a plan is not enough. Chess involves thinking what could happen if things go different than planned. In a way a plan that not involves different alternatives is not a real plan.
I’ve been reading these days about trading: buying and selling shares and other instruments.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I was listening a podcast aboutthe importance of being able to tell a story, not a lists of jobs when asked about you.
In a spirit of practising, I’m going to share two stories of my early life that affects who I am.
First, my family says I started to speak a bit late. But when I started to speak I did it almost like an adult.</description>

      <description>Black Friday is next Friday, so that means Christmas is coming. All around will push us to buy things: food, clothing, gifts.  A couple of weeks ago we started receiving some catalogs from several different NGOs. The basic idea is you buy gifts. For people that need those gifts. For people you don’t know. And you receive a card.
My initial reaction was a bit of sadness. I feel, from a faith perspective, that there is kind of a buying craziness at this time of the year.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why, one of my daughters proposed to create a system to find cars inside garages at the shopping center. The car would locate itself using a GPS and then it would emit via radio. I told her that GPS waves don&amp;rsquo;t go through the walls, and I tried to convince her to look for different approaches (like generating a wifi hotspot and using a mobile app, locate the car).</description>

      <title>What recruiters taught me about looking for a job</title>

      <description>There are good recruiters. And there are bad recruiters. The good ones help you to find a job. The bad ones teach you how to look for a job.
If you are looking for a job, be sure to do just the opposite of what the bad ones do.
Almost every other day I receive an email offering me a position.
&amp;ldquo;Good for you&amp;rdquo;. 
No, bad for me.
Most of the emails come from people I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to.</description>

      <description>More than six years ago I started this blog. I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.
Four years laterI came to London and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.
But it is not. I really think blogging is a good way to improve your written expression, to clarify your thoughts. And sometimes what you tell is worthwhile for others.</description>

      <description>I was made redundant at the end of March. It was a very stressful process but it ended up very well, as I&amp;rsquo;ve been in my new job for almost a month and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy.
During process, I had to work with lots of recruiters. Both from inside and outside my former company. One thing many people in the recruiting industry fail to understand is that every interaction counts. For better or for worse.</description>

      <title>Community managers: The day after</title>

      <description>Yesterday I followed on Twitter a case where the community manager for a -well known and with very good reputation- Spanish moving company literally screwed up their reputation.
He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag &amp;ldquo;vergonzoso&amp;rdquo; (shameful). IMO, the customer was not insulting and she was not threatening. Just complaining.
Initially I thought about yet another tactic to be viral.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)
Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.
I remember in particular one interview. It didn&amp;rsquo;t start well when I replied &amp;ldquo;Sí, I mean, yes&amp;rdquo; after listening my name with a perfect Spanish z sound (as it turned out, one of the interviewers was Spanish too).</description>

      <description>A year ago I was in a plane flying into London. I was in whirl, nearly panicking. My life about to change.
I&amp;rsquo;m somebody who loves being in his comfort zone. And then leaving your wife and daughters for 6 months. Leaving your country for who knows how much time.
It has been hard. There have been difficult times. In lots of different levels. Renting in London (well worth a million pages book).</description>

      <description>A few days ago my company sent out this press release. It seems to be rather unimportant, but for me it means changes.
I work for that specific business unit. I cannot write too much. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t know too much, but also because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell too much. But there are some topics I would like to raise.
In Spain, if your work is good and the company is doing great, whatever happens in between, has little importance.</description>

A good experience: IKEA. I recently bought some furniture from IKEA, using their online services in the UK. The furniture was delivered on Friday morning, and in the evening I discovered that there was package less than expected.</description>

      <description>Today I [rented a car for a few hours](http://www.zipcar.com/). I used to drive in Spain, but I hadn&#39;t driven since I came to London. I wanted to practice in not too stressful conditions before my family comes to visit me. Also I needed to buy some furniture. There are two problems for a Spanish driver in the UK (actually for most drivers from outside of the UK).&amp;nbsp; First. Cars have the steering wheel on the right hand side of the car, while outside the UK(overseas as they say) the steering wheel is on the left.</description>

      <description>When I started this blog, I had a goal. I needed to practice my English, because I wanted to go abroad. Months (or even years) later, more reasons appeared. First, I discovered that writing about solutions to job related problems could give people a way to solve their own problems more easily. Later on, I realized it could also be a way to show that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a newcomer while looking for a position abroad.</description>

But as you&amp;rsquo;ll imagine, I&amp;rsquo;m quite busy. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to post before starting in my new job, but I don&amp;rsquo;t promise anything. Thank you. Each and every one of you.</description>

Soon I forgot why: they were great by themselves. The topics are very diverse from Technology, Entrepenurship, Politics (Loom and Gloom Report), Education, Genetics&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Sometimes you start to write because you need to write but you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you want to express. This is one of those times.
A couple of days ago, a pregnant woman was killed, and another woman was wounded by a man in a church in Madrid and afterwards the man committed&amp;nbsp;suicide. Doctors performed a caesarean to the woman&amp;nbsp;assassinated&amp;nbsp;and the baby is alive. The man had a letter saying Satan was chasing him, and seems to be a homeless with police records.</description>

I was going to write about the challenge of a competitive examination, how challenges motivates me, and how my job keeps being interesting even though sometimes is a bit tough.
But then I came to &amp;ldquo;Reasons to work&amp;rdquo;. Seth Godin. No more words needed.</description>

But the experience has been worse. To pass through the security line is something stressful and disgusting. Wait a long queue. Put all your belongings through the X-ray.</description>

      <description>Yes. I know I was supposed to write about Civil service in Spain. But I&amp;rsquo;ve promised myself to write a blog post Monday through Thursday. Nobody reads this, my head is full of memories, and I&amp;rsquo;m not able to write about the planned topic. I could struggle with the it, but I prefer to write about my memories.

      <description>I wrote yesterday about why job security is a good mechanism to protect civil service from corruption. But I also explained that it&amp;rsquo;s a mechanism that makes difficult to punish slackers. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a serious problem if there were mechanism to reward people who do right. And the truth is that there aren&amp;rsquo;t. The salary has a variable part but could be more or less explained as &amp;ldquo;if you come to work twice a week in the afternoon, you get it&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a civil servant. Civil servants in Spain can&amp;rsquo;t be fired. Well, in fact they can be fired, but only because of extremely serious infringements, and after a complicated procedure.
This protection is intended to give security so that one civil servant can oppose employee&amp;rsquo;s chief orders if the employee thinks that what is being ordered is illegal. Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine I&amp;rsquo;m asked to delete certain documents in some repository. If I worked in a company and I don&amp;rsquo;t do delete them, I could be fired.</description>

      <title>Scrum for myself</title>

      <description>Yesterday I explained I have attended recently a couple of courses. One of them was about Scrum. The course was very interesting, although, as I explained in the evaluation, there were times when I wished there were only one teacher instead of three. At the end of the course, I took a test, and now I&amp;rsquo;m Scrum Manager certified. I must say that the exam was quite difficult, but I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a Scrum manager.</description>

      <description>The last few weeks have been really intense with respect to my career. I&amp;rsquo;ve attended two courses, given some presentations, launched a few projects at work, and read some books. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ve been under a lot of self-imposed pressure, but overall I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of things.
One of the books I&amp;rsquo;ve read has been really enlightening. It has been The passionate Programmer. It&amp;rsquo;s a book I wish I&amp;rsquo;d read years ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to buy a few copies and give them to some of my coworkers.</description>

      <description>6 months since last post. These have been amazing ones. Lots of work to do. Lots of challenges. We left Mantis, now working with Redmine. Learning Ruby on Rails. And learning Grails for fun and for the job.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying for another competitive examination for a civil servant positon, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t motivated. Exam is next Saturday but I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to pass
I haven&amp;rsquo;t had too much time to post.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on holidays, and I&amp;rsquo;ve had some spare time to stop and think.
Last couple of months have been special. Some events have affected profoundly.
One of those events has been the death of a collegue. Antonio was a young man. At least young for me, since he was in his early 40&amp;rsquo;s, only a few years older than me. Antonio was a nice guy. I remember him laughing a lot of times.</description>

      <description>Yes. It&amp;rsquo;s been three months since I wrote my previous post. When I started to write this blog I knew it could end like other blogs I have started. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I was going to stop writing so fast.
In fact I have some other blog I write from time to time. It&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;m not too persistent. I start things, because I have cool ideas. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have the guts to fight for them.</description>

      <title>What is this?</title>

      <description>Starting a blog it’s a difficult task. It’s not nearly as difficult as keeping updating it, of course.
I have started a couple of blogs.
Both are abandoned.
Not a good track.
Will this blog be different? I don’t know if I’ll continue updating this. But I know for sure this blog is different now.
The first difference is that I’m writing it in English. The reason I’m doing it, is because writing in English it’s an exercise for me.</description>

      <description>You know something is broken with copyright when:
You buy a &#34;Barbie and three Musqueteers&#34; DVD and you can&#39;t play in your DVD player because it&#39;s piracy protected. But... You download the same film from a P2P network, save to a CD and you can play it everywhere.
You can&#39;t install the Windows Vista that came with your computer, on a VirtualBox over a Linux box, because it refuses to activate.</description>
