      <description>For many people not living in the UK, it will come as a surprise that the railway system in London is quite expensive and provides a really bad service.

      <description>I enjoy buying books.
I read physical books too.
I enjoy starting them.
Honestly, finishing books is more difficult for me. But I’ve been trying to improve on that.
I was very excited when I bought ‘1776&amp;rsquo; by David McCullough.</description>

      <title>What recruiters taught me about looking for a job</title>

      <description>There are good recruiters. And there are bad recruiters. The good ones help you to find a job. The bad ones teach you how to look for a job.
If you are looking for a job, be sure to do just the opposite of what the bad ones do.</description>

      <description>More than six years ago I started this blog. I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.
Four years later I came to London and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I followed on Twitter a case where the community manager for a -well known and with very good reputation- Spanish moving company literally screwed up their reputation.
He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag &amp;ldquo;vergonzoso&amp;rdquo; (shameful).</description>

      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)
Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.</description>

      <description>A few days ago my company sent out this press release. It seems to be rather unimportant, but for me it means changes.
I work for that specific business unit. I cannot write too much.</description>

      <description>Below you can see the ad that in my opinion will end up being be the most popular video in Spain this Christmas
It depicts Fofito (a clown very well known in Spain) with other well known comedians, actors and even journalists, sending parcels to &amp;ldquo;important people&amp;rdquo;: from Angela Merkel and IMF to Moody&amp;rsquo;s and Standard&amp;amp;Poor&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>When I started this blog, I had a goal. I needed to practice my English, because I wanted to go abroad. Months (or even years) later, more reasons appeared. First, I discovered that writing about solutions to job related problems could give people a way to solve their own problems more easily.</description>

      <description>I tend to listen Techzing podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s a podcast about very different topics, recorded by two geeks, (or developers, and entrepeneurs). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when I started listening them. I do remember I started because I wanted to practice English and it was great (Justin is an Englishman and Jason is American).</description>

      <description>Sometimes you start to write because you need to write but you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you want to express. This is one of those times.
A couple of days ago, a pregnant woman was killed, and another woman was wounded by a man in a church in Madrid and afterwards the man committed suicide.</description>

      <description>Yes. It&amp;rsquo;s been three months since I wrote my previous post. When I started to write this blog I knew it could end like other blogs I have started. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I was going to stop writing so fast.</description>

      <description>Starting a blog it’s a difficult task. It’s not nearly as difficult as keeping updating it, of course.
I have started a couple of blogs.
Both are abandoned.
Not a good track.</description>
