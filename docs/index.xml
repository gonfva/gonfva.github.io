      <description>UPDATE: It turns out it was not crazy at all.
These days I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn Machine Learning(once again).
I&amp;rsquo;m more interested into understanding the fundamentals than running the race of prompt engineering and &amp;ldquo;ChatGPT&amp;rdquo; (and what is called LLM).</description>

      <description>Improving Windows build times in EKS I cannot believe a year has passed since my last annotation (which was also EKS and Windows related).
One of our most recent projects has been moving most of our build infrastructure to the cloud.</description>

      <description>Single instance with persistent EBS Sometimes you only want a single instance in AWS. But you know that everything fails, and you assume that your machine will fail too. You have your backups in place, but you have some data on disk that you would rather keep.</description>

      <description>NAT Gateway A quick intro in AWS networking In AWS, it is very common to create your own isolated network, in what is called a VPC (from virtual private cloud). The official (more like general perception) way of doing it, involves having multiple public and private subnets.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing again, even small things.
This week I was trying to create a Kubernetes cluster using Kops. In the end it didn&amp;rsquo;t work (mainly because it uses a Classic LoadBalancer and we don&amp;rsquo;t have public IPs in that VPC)</description>

      <description>Introduction A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.
AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public access.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.</description>

I enjoy starting them.
Honestly, finishing books is more difficult for me. But I’ve been trying to improve on that.

You cannot remove a movie from continue watching. You’ve already watched a movie, don’t want to see the credits, but Netflix thinks you haven’t reached the end.</description>

      <description>There is some outrage in Twitter because it has started to implement some changes to its product.
There was a change from stars to likes. I think I prefer stars because it conveys a different meaning: when I read something sad, I cannot click in Like, but I would click in star.</description>

If you are looking for a job, be sure to do just the opposite of what the bad ones do.</description>

      <description>More than six years ago I started this blog. I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.
Four years later I came to London and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I bid and won a PowerEdge 2650 server for three quids (plus another 6 of renting a car and collecting it).
It´s an old piece of hardware (32 bits double Xeon, 4gb of RAM), bulky as hell (or so does my back says) and noisy as a diesel generator.</description>

He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag &amp;ldquo;vergonzoso&amp;rdquo; (shameful).</description>

      <description>I tend to listen Techzing podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s a podcast about very different topics, recorded by two geeks, (or developers, and entrepeneurs). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when I started listening them. I do remember I started because I wanted to practice English and it was great (Justin is an Englishman and Jason is American).</description>

      <description>In last post I wrote why. In this post I want to explain how I wrote my first chrome extension.
First. The Chrome Extensions developer&amp;rsquo;s documentation is quite good.
Second. A chrome extension is a zip of a folder with an crx extension instead.</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about object calisthenics. They are a set of rules to help develop better:
One level of indentation per method&amp;lt; Don’t use the ELSE keyword Wrap all primitives and Strings First class collections One dot per line Don’t abbreviate Keep all entities small No classes with more than two instance variables No getters/setters/properties Some of them are a must, with some others I have some doubts.</description>

      <description>For more than three years I&amp;rsquo;ve been managing certificate-based digital signature applications.
One of the main source of pain always was and is generating the signature on the user browser. As it needs access to the user&amp;rsquo;s keystore, the browser alone didn&amp;rsquo;t have access to it, and was needed some kind of component (either ActiveX, usually a Java applet).</description>

      <description>Besides the console faking and the dependency inversion issue, my code in Ruby was pretty rough. You can see here the version I sent.
One obvious problem is the use of string instead of symbols.</description>

PLACE X,Y,F -&amp;gt; Places the robot in the x,y position facing F MOVE -&amp;gt; Move the robot 1 cell in the facing direction LEFT -&amp;gt; Changes the facing counter-clockwise RIGHT -&amp;gt; Changes the facing clockwise REPORT -&amp;gt; Shows the current position and facing and the main requirement was that the robot didn&amp;rsquo;t fall outside the board.</description>

      <description>This is one of my political/economical post (nothing related with computers) I write from time to time.
Past February, Spain published its estimation of whole year budget deficit.
Many well respected analysts suggested or explicitly wrote that maybe new Government was increasing 2011 deficit so that it could blame previous Government, and also in order to make it bigger so that it was easier to make it smaller.</description>

Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents.</description>

A couple of days ago, a pregnant woman was killed, and another woman was wounded by a man in a church in Madrid and afterwards the man committed suicide.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with politics. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s less known abroad, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably more important than the economic situation. First the government. Forget about the past. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by the end.</description>

      <description>I love this video:
A few days ago I received a message from one of my tweeps about the weather in Europe and in particular in Spain. This summer, the weather has been a bit strange so far.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s in the news. Spanish Government has declared &amp;ldquo;State of Emergency&amp;rdquo;. This declaration gives special powers to the government like the ability to limit the circulation of people, commandeer things or even enter in private properties (but not homes).</description>

I was going to write about the challenge of a competitive examination, how challenges motivates me, and how my job keeps being interesting even though sometimes is a bit tough.</description>
