<p>I&rsquo;ve been on holidays, and I&rsquo;ve had some spare time to stop and think.</p>
<p>Last couple of months have been special. Some events have affected profoundly.</p>
<p>One of those events has been the death of a collegue. Antonio was a young man. At least young for me, since he was in his early 40&rsquo;s, only a few years older than me. Antonio was a nice guy. I remember him laughing a lot of times. Antonio was smart, talented, and on a technical level he always had a different perspective too. As it turns out, it wasn&rsquo;t enough for him.</p>
<p>The second event was reading this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->inspiring post about how easy is to let your life flow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. While reading that article I felt like as I was looking at my life. I work better under presure. I want to point a couple of examples. One, while studying <!-- raw HTML omitted -->International Baccalaureate<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I worked a lot, learnt a lot and enjoy a lot. I felt alive. The other was while preparing the competitive examination to become a Civil Servant. My two daughters were one year old. My wife took care of them while I managed to study (a lot) after work, concentrating in the preparation while in the same house there were two little girls playing (and screaming ;D). But when there&rsquo;s nothing challenging, life flows.</p>
<p>I have a wonderful family that gives me a reason to live. I love my wife. I love my daughters. I don&rsquo;t feel depressed.</p>
<p>But I feel that, most of the time, life flows and I&rsquo;m carried rather walking. And I want to be walking. And I need new challenges.</p>
<p>The start of a new scholar year is a good time to plan them. They won&rsquo;t be huge challenges. But by writing them here I hope I can achieve them.</p>
<p>So here are they:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Books</strong>. I used to read a lot of books. I love reading. But I haven&rsquo;t been doing recently. Today I&rsquo;ve received <a href="http://www.gentedigital.es/blogs/gentedeinternet/32/blog-post/2383/101-libros-para-leer-antes-de-morir/">a list of essential novels</a> and I&rsquo;ve discovered I haven&rsquo;t read a lot of them. So I&rsquo;m planning to read at least <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tfv_BSQr4aHx8GPY6rAoGiQ&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html">20 books of that list I haven&rsquo;t read yet</a> until August 2010. That doesn&rsquo;t look too much. But I want to set some number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Blog</strong>. I like blogging, but I don&rsquo;t think I have too many interesting things to say. However, I want to practice my English. And I think this is an excellent way to do it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to try to post once a week until August 2010.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software developing</strong>. I like software development, but in my current position I do a more managerial work. So I&rsquo;m going to develop at home. The problem with this resolution is that it&rsquo;s not easy to quantify. Should I read new techniques?. I already do. Should I write X lines of code?. Oh c&rsquo;mon. I&rsquo;m not such a moron. So this resolution is to use three hours a week to develop something, probably some kind of web application to scratch a personal itch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to post my progress on these challenges in Twitter. Although the blog posting is easier to check here.</p>
