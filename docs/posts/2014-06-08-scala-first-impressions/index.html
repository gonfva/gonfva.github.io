      content="A couple of months ago I started working for a different company. I&#39;m quite happy there for many reasons. But one of them is having the opportunity to learn a new language: Scala. It&#39;s uncommon to get a programming job when you don&#39;t know the syntax of the programming language used. But if you really think about it, it&#39;s much better to hire somebody passionate about technology and that really loves to learn (and commit) than somebody that knows the language but doesn&#39;t give a d***mn."

          A couple of months ago I started working for a different company. I'm
          quite happy there for many reasons. But one of them is having the
          opportunity to learn a new language: Scala. It's uncommon to get a
          programming job when you don't know the syntax of the programming
          language used. But if you really think about it, it's much better to
          hire somebody passionate about technology and that really loves to
          learn (and commit) than somebody that knows the language but doesn't
          give a d***mn. Anyway, after a couple of months, I thought it would be
          good to write my experience about the language. First. What is Scala?
          <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a programming
          language that allows to develop both Object Oriented Programming and
          Functional programming. Functional programming is a new paradigm of
          developing that is opposed to Imperative programming. In a nutshell,
          imagine SQL, the language for querying databases. When writing a query
          you don't write code like "Take the first row, check if satisfies the
          WHERE clause, if it does, append to the list of results, take the
          following row...". You simply specify the criteria for the results and
          that's it. But that way of querying with SQL that it's inside of
          almost every developer's brain, involves a new way of thinking about
          problems for things that are not database queries. And, believe me, it
          takes time to learn. To the point that today, a couple of months
          later, and
          <a href="https://class.coursera.org/progfun-004">halfway a course</a>
          devoted to it, I keep writing imperative instead of Functional code.
          One could ask "if it is that complicated, why bother?".
          <a
            href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/multithreading-warning-lights.html"
            >Multithreading is tricky</a
          >, but CPUs have stopped increasing speed and they are increasing
          number of cores, which implies concurrency. Functional programming
          promises to help in that process. And in fact, one the emerging
          libraries in the Java field, the
          <a href="http://akka.io/">akka library</a>, comes from the Scala
          world. The famous lambda in Java 8 is functional programming.
          Regarding the specific language (not the functional paradigm), I have
          mixed feelings. I find it brilliant sometimes. And others I see it
          weird. As an example, I love the tuple concept (the ability for a
          function to return a couple of values at the same time without
          defining a class for that). But I almost scream each time I have to
          refer to the first element of the tuple with an _1 (<a
            href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6241464/why-are-the-indexes-of-scala-tuples-1-based"
            >as opposed to the typical _0</a
          >). I remember loving Ruby and Rails almost in any line of code.
          Everything felt natural and although in retrospective there were weird
          things, my general feeling was that code flows. With Scala I'm just
          starting to feel productive. With Scala love appears, but it tends to
          be in "this is freaking awesome" moments from time to time. [OMG, love
          and code. I'm really a nerd, isn't it?] Don't get me wrong. Once you
          get the hang of Scala, it is much much much better than Java. It has a
          strong typing system like java, but with type inference that allows to
          skip types in some declarations. It tends to be concise (sometimes to
          the extreme). In its origin, Scala allowed to generate code both for
          the JVM and .NET runtime environments. I suspect that's no longer the
          case and nobody develops in Scala using the .NET. One thing I find
          mind blowing (for bad and for good) is implicits. Implicits allow a
          type to be considered as a different one, upgrading the type to a
          different one. That is very powerful because the implicit mechanism
          relies in transforming functions (instead of inheritance or casting).
          Believe me when I say it is brilliant. But sometimes it leaves you
          scratching your head thinking why your code does not work until you
          remember to import the proper implicit conversion function. The editor
          would need a post on its own. There is an
          <a href="http://scala-ide.org/">Eclipse version for Scala</a>. But
          until last Monday, I wasn't able to do automatic indentation without
          risking to mangle my code. Refactoring is for brave. And I'm living in
          nightly updates for Scala-IDE. I've been told that IntelliJ is much
          better, but I'm trying to avoid it. Finally, learning a new language
          is not only the language itself, but a whole array of technologies
          around. OK. You learn Scala, and then you need to learn a web
          framework. Play would be the equivalent to the latest versions of
          Spring MVC or even Rails. But I'm in a love-hate relationship with
          <a href="http://liftweb.net/">lift</a>&nbsp;(which I find absolutely
          different to anything else except for
          <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a>). &nbsp;And you also need
          an ORM. The typical one would be hibernate in the Java world or
          ActiveRecord for ruby.
          <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick</a> is not the more used,
          but it is really promising. And that's it. I'm REALLY happy of being
          able to learn Scala. And I think it has transformed my programming
          habits for years to come (and it will do more if I leave behind the
          beginner level). To the point that

            >I read val instead of let</a
          >. I'm not entirely sure I would use Scala for all kind of projects.
          But certainly I would do for backend mission-critical code.
