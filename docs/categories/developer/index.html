      A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.
AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public accessWhen I read the initial reports, I thought the root cause was the usual “S3 bucket with public permissions” (S3 is a distributed object storage in AWS). It’s not uncommon that companies that are not very fluent with AWS permissions, end up making public a whole S3 bucket.

      I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.
When the path is difficult to followHowever, sometimes assigning permissions is tricky and it is not easy to understand what a specific permission means.
What follows is just one example I found on the Internet (i.

Most people in the software industry know Jira. For better or for worse, it’s the most used product for managing tickets, requests, bugs…
The company behind that product, Atlassian, has other products. One of them is called Bitbucket, and, similar to Github, it is a Source Code management system. My personal opinion is that Bitbucket is cheaper, but also that Github is better.

      One of the things less obvious for anyone trying to setup Cloudwatch alarms is the treatment of missing points.
You create an alarm, to detect too many 5xx errors in your ELB. But you don’t want it to be triggered too much, so you ask for at least one error per minute during 5 minutes. And you discover that the error gets triggered whenever during the last 5 minutes there was either zero, 2 or more.

      Werner’s keynote — https://youtu.be/65unhiJNaok?t=2692A few months ago, I went to AWS Summit London 2016. One of the takeaways for me was that the cloud is not only the ability to scale up, but also down.
And in particular, that you can shut down your servers. And you should if they are not used.
I knew the idea wasn’t strictly mine. What I didn’t know until I was preparing this post is that the idea came from Amazon’s CTO.

      Why One of the issues in a container-based architecture is how painful it is going from code to deployed containers.
Initially you can think it’s only two steps: build an deploy.
But when you pass the cowboy stage, things get more complicated. You need to analyse, test and build the code. You need to build the container with the new executable inside. You need to push the registry. And then you need to deploy the code, with potentially additional tests.

      So you are using AWS Elastic Load Balancer in front of a set of Apache httpd servers and you’ve discovered that your Apache logs are full of garbage. Here comes a set of tips to improve your logging:
 Put a specific endpoint for the health check and don’t log it. ELB needs to check if the endpoint is up and running, so it needs to periodically check an endpoint. By default, all those calls get logged, so better to filter them out.

      7 am in the morning. Some notifications in the mailbox and on Slack.
Big demo today and part of the system had gone down.
And had gone back up too. With no human intervention.
On closer examination, there were some wrinkles pending (we’ve learnt of them today). But on the whole, the system had responded great to an unplanned problem.
Yes, I know for sure that it’s nothing extraordinary. That’s what the cloud, availability zones, auto-scaling groups, clusters, or containers are for.

      Scala, for those who haven’t heard about it, is a programming language. It allows different ways of programming (functional programming but also object oriented programming) It can generate code that runs like, and interoperate seamlessly with, Java.
Scala is getting some traction in the enterprise world because of its features, but lately because it’s used in Spark: the tool of choice in many Big Data projects.
My experience Like many other people in the Scala world, I have some Java knowledge.

      A few years ago, I was leading a small team in charge of developers’ tools and framework. We discovered a bug, and the easiest way to solve it was to make a change in a different piece of functionality that wasn’t technically right, but was being heavily used. The functionality had security issues, specially if improperly used, and it provided a shortcut to the proper way to do things.
So we had some discussion among team members, but it seemed a no-brainier.

However, as in many of these events, the better part was meeting people. And the good part about being too self-conscious and shy for proper speaking is that you listen a lot.
And you hear guy A explaining to guy B how he’s working in developing a new feature for a startup and it’s going to take 4 months of a bunch of people, with no feedback involved until the big bang deployment.

      Besides the console faking and the dependency inversion issue, my code in Ruby was pretty rough. You can see here the version I sent. One obvious problem is the use of string instead of symbols. It was a bad bad mistake. So big if I had been the person testing, I would have thought very bad of myself. Anyway it was clear that Java version was considerably more verbose. So one obvious improvement is using symbols instead of string.

      In last post I wrote why. In this post I want to explain how I wrote my first chrome extension. First. The Chrome Extensions&nbsp;developer's documentation is quite good. Second. A chrome extension is a zip of a folder with an crx extension instead. The folder has to have a particular file called manifest.json. It tells the extension name and the permissions asked. It also points to the main file. Pretty standard in my case.

       Activate log4j. Without it you're lostLook through the log to see if you're getting the RequestMapping through Spring.If you are not despite correct annotations, see this post. In particular if you've got Spring Security installed, for Goodness sake, don't forget these lines:&lt;beans:bean class="org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.annotation.DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping"&gt;

It's uncommon to get a programming job when you don't know the syntax of the programming language used. But if you really think about it, it's much better to hire somebody passionate about technology and that really loves to learn (and commit) than somebody that knows the language but doesn't give a d***mn.

      I said in the previous post that Xalan and Xerces sometimes look like magic. So what are they and why are so complicated?. Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents. You can parse XML documents in different ways. You can transform into a memory structure, building a big object, or you can even parse only the elements you need. There's a whole array of ways to manage XML documents and schemas, and Xerces helps with them.

      In my previous entry, I tried to explain why Xerces and Xalan are so complicated. In this entry I want to focus in System.setProperty. Because, as I said that is the usual solution you are going to find when you need a specific parser for whatever reason. And that solution is wrong. Very wrong. Because, if you choose to change the provider using System.setProperty, you are changing the provider for all the applications in the container/server.

I was using a gem from TripIt. A gem is kind of a library for Ruby (sort of jar for Java). The gem simply encapsulated the API from TripIt. But it was failing and apparently everything on my project was correct. So this time it didn't took me too long to start debugging the actual gem's code.

      OK. I have explained why Xerces and Xalan are a source of problems, and I have explained why you shouldn't use System.setProperty to resolve them. In this post I wan't to give a few recipes to resolve Xerces and Xalan problems. Under no circumstances use System.setProperty anywhere in your application. I know I have already dedicated a post, but I wanted to stress it once more. Sometimes you'll need some specific parser (OC4J had a strange bug that needed a specific parser, and Weblogic seems to have special needs too).
