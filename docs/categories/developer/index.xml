      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m always full of ideas. But they never go beyond ideas. Maybe sometimes I would buy a domain and promise myself that &amp;ldquo;this is the one&amp;rdquo;. And the list of domains grows.</description>

      <description>[Really dull post about virtualization in Windows]&#xA;For the last couple of months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been (on and off) working with others in a project to migrate development environments so that we developers can use both virtual machines with Vagrant+Hyper-V AND WSL.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I heard for the first time the term low-background steel.&#xA;It seems steel produced before the Second World War is more valuable for certain applications. The reason is steel produced after the first nuclear tests was contaminated with traces of nuclear material from those tests in the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>Single instance with persistent EBS Sometimes you only want a single instance in AWS. But you know that everything fails, and you assume that your machine will fail too. You have your backups in place, but you have some data on disk that you would rather keep.</description>

      <description>NAT Gateway A quick intro in AWS networking In AWS, it is very common to create your own isolated network, in what is called a VPC (from virtual private cloud). The official (more like general perception) way of doing it, involves having multiple public and private subnets.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.</description>
