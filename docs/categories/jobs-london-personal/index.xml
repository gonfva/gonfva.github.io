      <description>A few days ago my company sent out this press release. It seems to be rather unimportant, but for me it means changes. I work for that specific business unit. I cannot write too much. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t know too much, but also because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to tell too much. But there are some topics I would like to raise.
In Spain, if your work is good and the company is doing great, whatever happens in between, has little importance.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less) Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case. I remember in particular one interview. It didn&amp;rsquo;t start well when I replied &amp;ldquo;Sí, I mean, yes&amp;rdquo; after listening my name with a perfect Spanish z sound (as it turned out, one of the interviewers was Spanish too).</description>
