        Civil service in Spain: Job security

      I'm a civil servant. Civil servants in Spain can't be fired. Well, in fact they can be fired, but only because of extremely serious infringements, and after a complicated procedure. This protection is intended to give security so that one civil servant can oppose employee's chief orders if the employee thinks that what is being ordered is illegal. Let's imagine I'm asked to delete certain documents in some repository. If I worked in a company and I don't do delete them, I could be fired.

      I wrote yesterday about why job security is a good mechanism to protect civil service from corruption. But I also explained that it's a mechanism that makes difficult to punish slackers. That wouldn't be a serious problem if there were mechanism to reward people who do right. And the truth is that there aren't. The salary has a variable part but could be more or less explained as "if you come to work twice a week in the afternoon, you get it"

      A few days ago I promised to explain some of my ideas to improve the civil service in Spain. Of course there is no silver bullet. Instead, as you can see the links, all the bricks are in place: Try to introduce economic incentives. People who work should be rewarded. Of course that could be misused to give more money to friends instead of giving it to the people who work.

      I've been Google fanboy for a long time.&nbsp;I remember the invitation for Gmail I received around mid-2004. Gmail was a revolution. From 50MB mail space at the time, they offered 1000MB (1GB). But the size wasn't the only thing revolutionary. A great UI interface, faster than anything seen before was shocking. I remember Google video chat. Being able to talk from the mail. "No installations". Even Google Wave was revolutionary although the launch was a big failure, and the project was more in Alpha than in Beta.

      I was a Spanish Civil Servant from 2006 to 2012 (technically I'm still a Spanish Civil Servant on leave). I've worked for different branches of the Spanish Government from September 2000 to November 2012. Civil Service in Spain is reputed to be lazy among Spaniards. But having worked for all kind of employers (startups, multinationals, NGO and Government Agencies), I can say I've found lazy people there but I've also found engaged workers.

      I’ve been a couple of days in Zaragoza (Spain), participating in Tecnimap 2010 last week. Tecnimap is a conference on IT for the Public Administration in Spain. I had presented a paper about one of the applications I manage: DocelWeb.
Overall it has been a nice experience, but I wanted to share some thoughts about it.
On a personal level, I think I was wrong in my planning. I planned to assist to few conferences and talks that I really wanted to assist, and scheduled the rest of the time for relationships and stands.

      A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.
AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public accessWhen I read the initial reports, I thought the root cause was the usual “S3 bucket with public permissions” (S3 is a distributed object storage in AWS). It’s not uncommon that companies that are not very fluent with AWS permissions, end up making public a whole S3 bucket.

      I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.
When the path is difficult to followHowever, sometimes assigning permissions is tricky and it is not easy to understand what a specific permission means.
What follows is just one example I found on the Internet (i.

Most people in the software industry know Jira. For better or for worse, it’s the most used product for managing tickets, requests, bugs…
The company behind that product, Atlassian, has other products. One of them is called Bitbucket, and, similar to Github, it is a Source Code management system. My personal opinion is that Bitbucket is cheaper, but also that Github is better.

      One of the things less obvious for anyone trying to setup Cloudwatch alarms is the treatment of missing points.
You create an alarm, to detect too many 5xx errors in your ELB. But you don’t want it to be triggered too much, so you ask for at least one error per minute during 5 minutes. And you discover that the error gets triggered whenever during the last 5 minutes there was either zero, 2 or more.

      Imagine you are interviewing some guy for an IT role and she says that he doesn’t get that of “going to the cloud because everybody knows there are no datacenters in the sky”.
Everybody knows that cloud in cloud computing is just a name.
However, it’s surprising how many people have a similar idea. You chat with someone in IT about “serverless” and she says something like “Serverless doesn’t make any sense.

      Werner’s keynote — https://youtu.be/65unhiJNaok?t=2692A few months ago, I went to AWS Summit London 2016. One of the takeaways for me was that the cloud is not only the ability to scale up, but also down.
And in particular, that you can shut down your servers. And you should if they are not used.
I knew the idea wasn’t strictly mine. What I didn’t know until I was preparing this post is that the idea came from Amazon’s CTO.

      Why One of the issues in a container-based architecture is how painful it is going from code to deployed containers.
Initially you can think it’s only two steps: build an deploy.
But when you pass the cowboy stage, things get more complicated. You need to analyse, test and build the code. You need to build the container with the new executable inside. You need to push the registry. And then you need to deploy the code, with potentially additional tests.

      So you are using AWS Elastic Load Balancer in front of a set of Apache httpd servers and you’ve discovered that your Apache logs are full of garbage. Here comes a set of tips to improve your logging:
 Put a specific endpoint for the health check and don’t log it. ELB needs to check if the endpoint is up and running, so it needs to periodically check an endpoint. By default, all those calls get logged, so better to filter them out.

      A few years ago, I was leading a small team in charge of developers’ tools and framework. We discovered a bug, and the easiest way to solve it was to make a change in a different piece of functionality that wasn’t technically right, but was being heavily used. The functionality had security issues, specially if improperly used, and it provided a shortcut to the proper way to do things.
So we had some discussion among team members, but it seemed a no-brainier.

I've been busy last couple of days trying to make Mantis work with a Microsoft SQL Server database on a Windows Server 2003. Many people would ask why to use MSSQL instead of Mysql, a much better DBMS, not mention the OS election. I'm not planning to enter in a flame war. I wanted a free bug tracking system that worked with MSSQL. Candidates were Bugzilla, with higly experimental MSSQL support, BugTracker .

      I have been fighting with PHP, Mantis and SOAP since my last post. Now I think I have discovered a bug when uploading via Mantis SOAP a binary file. It's great being able to debug a PHP application. I hope what I discovered is useful for more people. But I've discovered something quite shocking: I wasn't able to find any good answers to something that must be frequent. I was uploading a binary file sending nulls: 00 00 00 or when base64-encoded: AAAA (in hex 41 41 41 41).

      A few days ago I went to an interview which included a pair programming session. The session was a great experience, but the result wasn't quite as good as it should have been, because of some difficulties understanding on what was being asked. It didn't help it was my first experience working with a Mac. At one point we agreed on creating a new constructor so that we could pass a service in the constructor instead of getting directly in the method under test.

      I said in the previous post that Xalan and Xerces sometimes look like magic. So what are they and why are so complicated?. Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents. You can parse XML documents in different ways. You can transform into a memory structure, building a big object, or you can even parse only the elements you need. There's a whole array of ways to manage XML documents and schemas, and Xerces helps with them.

      In my previous entry, I tried to explain why Xerces and Xalan are so complicated. In this entry I want to focus in System.setProperty. Because, as I said that is the usual solution you are going to find when you need a specific parser for whatever reason. And that solution is wrong. Very wrong. Because, if you choose to change the provider using System.setProperty, you are changing the provider for all the applications in the container/server.

      OK. I have explained why Xerces and Xalan are a source of problems, and I have explained why you shouldn't use System.setProperty to resolve them. In this post I wan't to give a few recipes to resolve Xerces and Xalan problems. Under no circumstances use System.setProperty anywhere in your application. I know I have already dedicated a post, but I wanted to stress it once more. Sometimes you'll need some specific parser (OC4J had a strange bug that needed a specific parser, and Weblogic seems to have special needs too).

      A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.
AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public accessWhen I read the initial reports, I thought the root cause was the usual “S3 bucket with public permissions” (S3 is a distributed object storage in AWS). It’s not uncommon that companies that are not very fluent with AWS permissions, end up making public a whole S3 bucket.

You create an alarm, to detect too many 5xx errors in your ELB. But you don’t want it to be triggered too much, so you ask for at least one error per minute during 5 minutes. And you discover that the error gets triggered whenever during the last 5 minutes there was either zero, 2 or more.

 Put a specific endpoint for the health check and don’t log it. ELB needs to check if the endpoint is up and running, so it needs to periodically check an endpoint. By default, all those calls get logged, so better to filter them out.

      I said in the previous post that Xalan and Xerces sometimes look like magic. So what are they and why are so complicated?. Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents. You can parse XML documents in different ways. You can transform into a memory structure, building a big object, or you can even parse only the elements you need. There's a whole array of ways to manage XML documents and schemas, and Xerces helps with them.

Because, if you choose to change the provider using System.setProperty, you are changing the provider for all the applications in the container/server.

      OK. I have explained why Xerces and Xalan are a source of problems, and I have explained why you shouldn't use System.setProperty to resolve them. In this post I wan't to give a few recipes to resolve Xerces and Xalan problems. Under no circumstances use System.setProperty anywhere in your application.

In my previous post I explained how to make Java choose a class for a parser.

This is a bit impersonal.
I know. I’m sorry. The alternative is the above email for everyone.
You have some desired technologies under your belt.
Yes, I know.
Are you happy in your current job? Could you consider other roles?

      For the last month or so I’ve been running a small experiment in my Linkedin profile. I had been receiving contacts from recruiters offering roles, and from recruiters offering developers. I’m not quite interested in any of those services. Frankly, the job market for technology is a crazy house. Companies recruiting on readers of “Cracking the coding interview” instead of culture. Recruiters literally spamming or even sometimes harassing. And “candidates” either jumping for salary or just “getting a job”.

I receive lots of messages from recruiters. I get offered to participate in events so that companies can offer me new jobs.
I tend to reply something like:
 Hi , Thank you for your message. However, at the moment I’m not interested in new opportunities. Kind regards, GonzaloI feel this kind of message does not explain the ultimate reason behind my reply.

In my experience (it could be biased), 90% of them are just form fillers. They ask you things (CV, tests, questions), in order to fill a form in a random web site.

Train service is not a theme park. It affects people’s livesSome of my Spanish readers will think “surely that cannot be true”. After all, railway was born in the UK. And punctuality is probably one of the words when a Spaniard thinks of British people.

Honestly, finishing books is more difficult for me. But I’ve been trying to improve on that.
I was very excited when I bought ‘1776' by David McCullough. The title is a reference to the year when American Independence was proclaimed. However the book starts narrating in mid 1775 and ends at well into 1777, and it is more about the Rebellion/War for Independence in those years.

      When I was child, I used to play chess. From time to time you would find somebody that just had learned a special kind of opening and had decided to practice no matter what.
But having a plan is not enough. Chess involves thinking what could happen if things go different than planned. In a way a plan that not involves different alternatives is not a real plan.
I’ve been reading these days about trading: buying and selling shares and other instruments.

First, my family says I started to speak a bit late. But when I started to speak I did it almost like an adult.

      Black Friday is next Friday, so that means Christmas is coming. All around will push us to buy things: food, clothing, gifts.
A couple of weeks ago we started receiving some catalogs from several different NGOs. The basic idea is you buy gifts. For people that need those gifts. For people you don’t know. And you receive a card.
My initial reaction was a bit of sadness. I feel, from a faith perspective, that there is kind of a buying craziness at this time of the year.

      Yesterday I followed on Twitter a case where the community manager for a -well known and with very good reputation- Spanish moving company&nbsp;literally screwed up their reputation. He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag "vergonzoso" (shameful). IMO, the customer was not insulting and she was not threatening. Just complaining. Initially I thought about yet another tactic to be viral.

There are two problems for a Spanish driver in the UK (actually for most drivers from outside of the UK).&nbsp;
First. Cars have the steering wheel on the right hand side of the car, while outside the UK(overseas as they say) the steering wheel is on the left.

      These days I’m reading a fascinating book on Roman History called SPQR. And I’ve discovered Roman History is full of lessons for today’s world.
As a small token, a line from Plautus, a Roman writer, that appeared in some of his books.
 Demophilus wrote this, Plautus barbarised it.As Mary Beard, the author of SPQR, explains, the sentence was a clever challenge.
 For people of Greek origin, it was a way to mock Romans, that didn’t bring anything new.

      When I was child, I used to play chess. From time to time you would find somebody that just had learned a special kind of opening and had decided to practice no matter what.
But having a plan is not enough. Chess involves thinking what could happen if things go different than planned. In a way a plan that not involves different alternatives is not a real plan.

In Spain there is some buzz recently about tax increases&nbsp;approved&nbsp;on December 30th.

The commitment was to finalize 2011 with a 6% GDP, from 9.2 previous year.&nbsp;
OK. Here is my take. We will end 2011 with more than 9% GDP.

      This is one of my political/economical post (nothing related with computers) I write from time to time. Past February, Spain published its estimation of whole year budget deficit. Many well respected analysts suggested or&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;wrote that maybe new Government was increasing 2011 deficit so that it could blame previous Government, and also in order to make it bigger so that it was easier to make it smaller. One for all, Xavier Xala i Martin: Los números presentados hoy los ha construido el gobierno del Partido Popular y evalúan el año 2011, último año de gobierno del Partido Socialista.

      It's in the news. Spanish Government has declared "State of Emergency". This declaration gives special powers to the government like the ability to limit the circulation of people, commandeer things or even enter in private properties (but not homes).
It's somewhat similar to State of Siege, but lower in intensity. Being Spain a democracy one could think that this kind of declaration should be reserved to extreme cases. That's true in the law.

Let's imagine I'm asked to delete certain documents in some repository. If I worked in a company and I don't do delete them, I could be fired.

Income data from May 2009 (and probably June) was tricky because taxes returns were accelerated so that people could vote with their money back in the pocket.Data for income and expenses was only for the national services. But in Spain we have nearly federal organization, so local and regional services must be taken into account.

Let’s Encrypt is a foundation that gives certificates away for free. Not only that. Let’s Encrypt is trying to make installing and renewing a certificate effortless.
I decided to read the report which is more a blog post.
Apparently the argument of the report is that Let’s Encrypt doesn’t do a proper validation before giving away the certificates.

However acquisitions are not going to change anything. And it is not because people in those banks don’t have a clue.

A woman walking along the aisle, stopped next to my wife, started a conversation with her about my daughters’ reading habits, and asked my wife what model of e-book reader we thought is better (so that she could give it to their own children).

      A couple of weeks ago, I had an interesting discussion in Twitter about how a Spanish Government body (AEAT, the equivalent of HRMC in the UK or IRS in the US) was offering different “services” in two different websites.
For those not fluent in Spanish, think of going to one site to read email and going to a different site to write it.
Obviously, the experience was poor and confusing for the user, who doesn’t understand what is the pattern that puts a set of things under one address and a different set under a different one.

      Sometimes you realize you've written a weak post too late. It was my case with yesterday's annotation. I thought nobody would even read it. But it seems that, because of a trackback at Gmail Blog, I was wrong. Fortunately, Matt Sealey (thank you, Matt), was kind enough to comment, pointing out one of the weakest parts. He says that Google's movement only affects a portion of Skype's services. With Gmail you won't be able to call to real phones (he says "

      Today I wanted to talk about two acquisitions. On one side, Facebook and Whatsapp. $19 billion. There are many different opinions. Craziness. Logic. IMO the money paid is crazy, but the deal has a lot of logic for Facebook. Because for many people around me (including teens), Whatsapp is THE social network. They(we?) share things like images and videos, status. We use it almost everyday. Food for thought: when was the last time you got to know anything reading it on Facebook?

      A few months ago,I upgraded the firmware for my Sony Xperia U. It turns out that the place I used to download the firmware updates from, wasn't providing new updates, so sometime ago, I migrated to a new source of firmware updates.
I knew that Cyanogenmod was already providing Over The Air (OTA) updates. What I didn't know is that today's update would bring Android 4.4.3 when even people with a Nexus 7 has not receive Google's update yet.

      As I said on my last post, I think that integration of Video and voice chat could be part of a greater strategy. What would be that strategy? In my opinion it should have two parts. The first one would include the ability to search on your communications. Not only your written communications, but also your oral/video communications. The technology is not too far. We can today search on Youtube's speeches, probably thanks to GOOG 411.

      I've been Google fanboy for a long time.&nbsp;I remember the invitation for Gmail I received around mid-2004. Gmail was a revolution. From 50MB mail space at the time, they offered 1000MB (1GB). But the size wasn't the only thing revolutionary. A great UI interface, faster than anything seen before was shocking. I remember Google video chat. Being able to talk from the mail. "No installations". Even Google Wave was revolutionary although the launch was a big failure, and the project was more in Alpha than in Beta.

Apparently, that is no longer the case.

      For more than three years I've been managing certificate-based digital signature applications. &nbsp;One of the main source of pain always was and is generating the signature on the user browser. As it needs access to the user's keystore, the browser alone didn't have access to it, and was needed some kind of component (either ActiveX, usually a Java applet). The deployment of the component and the debugging of different OS/browser/Java version configurations tends to be time consuming.

Overall it has been a nice experience, but I wanted to share some thoughts about it.
On a personal level, I think I was wrong in my planning. I planned to assist to few conferences and talks that I really wanted to assist, and scheduled the rest of the time for relationships and stands.

Anyway Yahoo has services that are (in my opinion) far better than Google’s.
