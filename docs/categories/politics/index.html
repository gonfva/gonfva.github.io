      These days I’m reading a fascinating book on Roman History called SPQR. And I’ve discovered Roman History is full of lessons for today’s world.
As a small token, a line from Plautus, a Roman writer, that appeared in some of his books.
 Demophilus wrote this, Plautus barbarised it.As Mary Beard, the author of SPQR, explains, the sentence was a clever challenge.
 For people of Greek origin, it was a way to mock Romans, that didn’t bring anything new.

      When I was child, I used to play chess. From time to time you would find somebody that just had learned a special kind of opening and had decided to practice no matter what.
But having a plan is not enough. Chess involves thinking what could happen if things go different than planned. In a way a plan that not involves different alternatives is not a real plan.
I’ve been reading these days about trading: buying and selling shares and other instruments.

I&rsquo;ve just read a piece of news about Moody&rsquo;s considering Spanish outlook stable. Although I don&rsquo;t foresee a default&rsquo;s risk, I completely disagree. I think Spanish conditions are deteriorating very fast. I recommend reading this article on Moody&rsquo;s decision.

      Disclaimer: I'm talking about public data. I don't have any unpublished data.

In Spain there is some buzz recently about tax increases&nbsp;approved&nbsp;on December 30th. The government had changed and the new one said it was necessary to raise taxes because data said budget deficit where 8% GDP. The commitment was to finalize 2011 with a 6% GDP, from 9.2 previous year.&nbsp;
OK. Here is my take. We will end 2011 with more than 9% GDP.

      This is one of my political/economical post (nothing related with computers) I write from time to time. Past February, Spain published its estimation of whole year budget deficit. Many well respected analysts suggested or&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;wrote that maybe new Government was increasing 2011 deficit so that it could blame previous Government, and also in order to make it bigger so that it was easier to make it smaller. One for all, Xavier Xala i Martin: Los números presentados hoy los ha construido el gobierno del Partido Popular y evalúan el año 2011, último año de gobierno del Partido Socialista.

More recently there has been some comments in Spain regarding the publication of regions' budget deficit up to second quarter. But I&nbsp;don't really understand why people insist to pay attention to quarterly data without reference to a twelve month period. Let's do the math.

      I was a Spanish Civil Servant from 2006 to 2012 (technically I'm still a Spanish Civil Servant on leave). I've worked for different branches of the Spanish Government from September 2000 to November 2012. Civil Service in Spain is reputed to be lazy among Spaniards. But having worked for all kind of employers (startups, multinationals, NGO and Government Agencies), I can say I've found lazy people there but I've also found engaged workers.

      From time to time I visit the page where the internal comptroller in Spain posts its budget deficit figures. Last week there was a link to the calendar of future publications. The calendar was last updated past September, and didn´t show anything for 2013. Usually at the end of January appears 3rd quarter budget deficit. So when January ended with no new data, I knew the figures would be bad.

From time I tend to write about the Spanish budget deficit. Almost nobody expects that Spain will meet its commitment around budget deficit for 2012. Well. I want to say, that, regarding central government, I do think they are going to hit the target.

      It's in the news. Spanish Government has declared "State of Emergency". This declaration gives special powers to the government like the ability to limit the circulation of people, commandeer things or even enter in private properties (but not homes).
It's somewhat similar to State of Siege, but lower in intensity. Being Spain a democracy one could think that this kind of declaration should be reserved to extreme cases. That's true in the law.

Spanish bonds at what lots of people understand as intervention level (400 basis points over German debt).
