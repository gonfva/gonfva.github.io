      <description>I enjoy buying books.
I read physical books too.
I enjoy starting them.
Honestly, finishing books is more difficult for me. But I’ve been trying to improve on that.
I was very excited when I bought ‘1776&amp;rsquo; by David McCullough.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I was listening a podcast about the importance of being able to tell a story, not a lists of jobs when asked about you.
In a spirit of practising, I’m going to share two stories of my early life that affects who I am.</description>

      <description>Black Friday is next Friday, so that means Christmas is coming. All around will push us to buy things: food, clothing, gifts. A couple of weeks ago we started receiving some catalogs from several different NGOs.</description>

      <title>What recruiters taught me about looking for a job</title>

      <guid>https://gonzalo.f-v.es/blog/2015-01-06-what-recruiters-taught-me-about-looking/</guid>
      <description>There are good recruiters. And there are bad recruiters. The good ones help you to find a job. The bad ones teach you how to look for a job.
If you are looking for a job, be sure to do just the opposite of what the bad ones do.</description>

      <description>More than six years ago I started this blog. I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.
Four years later I came to London and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy.
I was developing a feature that allows to export from my showcase project Whendoigo to TripIt.
I was using a gem from TripIt. A gem is kind of a library for Ruby (sort of jar for Java).</description>

      <guid>https://gonzalo.f-v.es/blog/2014-02-03-community-managers-day-after/</guid>
      <description>Yesterday I followed on Twitter a case where the community manager for a -well known and with very good reputation- Spanish moving company literally screwed up their reputation.
He/she threatened to sue a customer that was expressing a complaint on Twitter, because the client had used the hash tag &amp;ldquo;vergonzoso&amp;rdquo; (shameful).</description>

      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)
Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.</description>

      <description>I tend to listen Techzing podcast. It&amp;rsquo;s a podcast about very different topics, recorded by two geeks, (or developers, and entrepeneurs). I don&amp;rsquo;t remember when I started listening them. I do remember I started because I wanted to practice English and it was great (Justin is an Englishman and Jason is American).</description>

      <description>Sometimes you start to write because you need to write but you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you want to express. This is one of those times.
A couple of days ago, a pregnant woman was killed, and another woman was wounded by a man in a church in Madrid and afterwards the man committed suicide.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m attending this week to a Spring Framework course. It&amp;rsquo;s a very small class: the teacher, my boss and me.
I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself slow, and neither is my boss. No, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t read this blog.</description>

      <description>You know something is broken with copyright when:
You buy a &amp;ldquo;Barbie and three Musqueteers&amp;rdquo; DVD and you can&amp;rsquo;t play in your DVD player because it&amp;rsquo;s piracy protected. But&amp;hellip; You download the same film from a P2P network, save to a CD and you can play it everywhere.</description>
