      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to start writing again, even small things.&#xA;This week I was trying to create a Kubernetes cluster using Kops. In the end it didn&amp;rsquo;t work (mainly because it uses a Classic LoadBalancer and we don&amp;rsquo;t have public IPs in that VPC)</description>

      <description>Introduction A few weeks ago there was an attack on Capital One’s AWS infrastructure that lead to the compromise of personal information on around 100M people.&#xA;AWS is putting great effort in avoiding S3 buckets configured for public access.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing some research on credentials compromise and abuse in AWS. In the process, it was obvious that the main mitigation would be (is) to minimise the permissions assigned to the EC2 instance profile, applying the “least privilege principle”.</description>

      <description>One of the things less obvious for anyone trying to setup Cloudwatch alarms is the treatment of missing points.&#xA;You create an alarm, to detect too many 5xx errors in your ELB.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m happy.&#xA;I was developing a feature that allows to export from my showcase project Whendoigo to TripIt.&#xA;I was using a gem from TripIt. A gem is kind of a library for Ruby (sort of jar for Java).</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t.&#xA;In the last week or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been hitting against a wall because of two different bugs. I was sure that both bugs were my fault. It took me ages (of a scarce spare time) trying different things, searching for similar problems, until in both cases I finally came to an issue in different tools.</description>

      <description>OK. I have explained why Xerces and Xalan are a source of problems, and I have explained why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use System.setProperty to resolve them. In this post I wan&amp;rsquo;t to give a few recipes to resolve Xerces and Xalan problems.</description>

      <description>In my previous entry, I tried to explain why Xerces and Xalan are so complicated. In this entry I want to focus in System.setProperty. Because, as I said that is the usual solution you are going to find when you need a specific parser for whatever reason.</description>

      <description>I said in the previous post that Xalan and Xerces sometimes look like magic. So what are they and why are so complicated?.&#xA;Xerces is a Java library that helps parsing, validating and managing XML documents.</description>
