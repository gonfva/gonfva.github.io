      For many people not living in the UK, it will come as a surprise that the railway system in London is quite expensive and provides a really bad service.
Train service is not a theme park. It affects people’s livesSome of my Spanish readers will think “surely that cannot be true”. After all, railway was born in the UK. And punctuality is probably one of the words when a Spaniard thinks of British people.

You can read more about it in this article. Not sure how this will work in real life.
But the demo looks amazing.

Crypto investments being announced in a bus stop in the middle of London.I remember vividly that some people around me were trying to setup a startup, raise money with some vague promise, and be rich.

 You cannot remove a movie from continue watching. You’ve already watched a movie, don’t want to see the credits, butNetflix thinks you haven’t reached the end. Or you get bored of a movie half way. I even have a thumbs down on “Iron Fist” and it keeps appearing!!! How do you remove those movies you don’t want to keep watching?

      There is a new report that associates Let’s Encrypt with phishing. So lots of people in Twitter started screaming because they read phishing and Paypal in the same sentence.
Let’s Encrypt is a foundation that gives certificates away for free. Not only that. Let’s Encrypt is trying to make installing and renewing a certificate effortless.
I decided to read the report which is more a blog post.
Apparently the argument of the report is that Let’s Encrypt doesn’t do a proper validation before giving away the certificates.

So here are some comments about it:
 AFAICT the s3 outage was in us-east-1 region. Other regions didn’t have S3 affected. S3 in Europe* This is not the first s3 outage. You may have read about what this affects the 11 nines promise. Most likely, it doesn’t .

Yes. It is going to happen. It has already happened. BBVA has already bought Simple and Atom. And it took them two years to start integrating Simple in a meaningful way.
However acquisitions are not going to change anything. And it is not because people in those banks don’t have a clue.

      Today I was reading this article about excuses from banks for crap services. Then I got to this sentence:
 Consumers need to understand that the balance you see is not necessarily your actual available balance because there are so many moving partsNo. Consumers don’t need to understand anything like that. It is your job to simplify things. And you even fail to recognise it.
 I’ve mentioned it before. I have worked for highly formalised organisations and I know from inside that sometimes it’s very difficult to disrupt our own organisation.

      Yesterday I was using my bank account, taking money out using a debit card. No way to see the operation since the feed only has old/settled operations. Since the available balance was below what I considered safe, I moved back the money using the same card.
Available balance didn’t change. And when days later, both operations were settled, one appeared in one day, the other the following day.
My bank allows me to do banking and investment.

On my own, I discovered that creating dynamic we pages was tricky. Dynamic web pages require interacting with the user. But interacting with the user meant risking trusting the user.
Some examples I started taking a look to other dynamic web pages.

Moments is something that appeared in the header of Twitter, but I haven’t clicked more than 3 times (the last one while preparing this post) Now it seems they’re going to put a “While you were away” on steroids.

      Broken Kindle anyone?A couple of months ago, we were flying back to London after the summer. My 12 year old twin daughters, usually eager video watchers or passionate console players, were avid readers at that moment. To the point they were sharing one of their two physical Kindle reading devices.
A woman walking along the aisle, stopped next to my wife, started a conversation with her about my daughters’ reading habits, and asked my wife what model of e-book reader we thought is better (so that she could give it to their own children).

For those not fluent in Spanish, think of going to one site to read email and going to a different site to write it.
Obviously, the experience was poor and confusing for the user, who doesn’t understand what is the pattern that puts a set of things under one address and a different set under a different one.

Anyway Yahoo has services that are (in my opinion) far better than Google’s. My favourite is a nearly unknown project called myweb, which could be said to be related to Google Bookmarks or Google Notebook.

In my opinion it should have two parts.
The first one would include the ability to search on your communications. Not only your written communications, but also your oral/video communications. The technology is not too far. We can today search on Youtube&rsquo;s speeches, probably thanks to GOOG 411.

From 50MB mail space at the time, they offered 1000MB (1GB). But the size wasn't the only thing revolutionary. A great UI interface, faster than anything seen before was shocking. I remember Google video chat. Being able to talk from the mail. "No installations". Even Google Wave was revolutionary although the launch was a big failure, and the project was more in Alpha than in Beta.

      A few weeks ago, I bid and won a PowerEdge 2650&nbsp;server for three quids (plus another 6 of renting a car and collecting it). It´s an old piece of hardware (32 bits double Xeon, 4gb of RAM), bulky as hell (or so does my back says) and noisy as a diesel generator. When I came home, my daughters said that couldn't be a computer as it didn't have input/output devices like a keyboard or a monitor.

      I have an old Dell Vostro 1720 and an Acer Aspire One AO110. Both are usable (and used), but have no battery. So when I got my shiny brand new Mac, I decided I had to look after the battery. And I read everything I could find about how to take care Macbook's battery. Apparently, old models used to need a periodic full discharge followed by a full recharge. Apparently, that is no longer the case.

      I'm learning some technologies. I'm tempted to write new, but they're not new. I'm learning Ruby on Rails and mobile development. I still have to keep learning Java, and Grails, but I have a project in mind and I wanted to separate clearly from my day to day job, for lots of reasons.
Some other day I'll posts my thoughts about mobile development. But today I wanted to share that I have deployed my first application to my iTouch.

      For more than three years I've been managing certificate-based digital signature applications. &nbsp;One of the main source of pain always was and is generating the signature on the user browser. As it needs access to the user's keystore, the browser alone didn't have access to it, and was needed some kind of component (either ActiveX, usually a Java applet). The deployment of the component and the debugging of different OS/browser/Java version configurations tends to be time consuming.

      I’ve been a couple of days in Zaragoza (Spain), participating in Tecnimap 2010 last week. Tecnimap is a conference on IT for the Public Administration in Spain. I had presented a paper about one of the applications I manage: DocelWeb.
Overall it has been a nice experience, but I wanted to share some thoughts about it.
On a personal level, I think I was wrong in my planning. I planned to assist to few conferences and talks that I really wanted to assist, and scheduled the rest of the time for relationships and stands.

      I'm attending this week to a Spring Framework course. It's a very small class: the teacher, my boss and me. I don't consider myself slow, and neither is my boss. No, he doesn't read this blog. But we two were trying to keep up the frenetic pace the teacher is imposing. I had already used Spring, but up to now I didn't suppose who little did I know about Spring, about TDD, or even about Eclipse.

      I have a two years old&nbsp;Symbian&nbsp;cell phone and a second generation iTouch. I guess that's enough to explain that until very recently I didn't pay any attention at all to mobiles apps ads. Companies regularly announced new &nbsp;apps for the Apple Store (or the Android one), and I didn't even read the announce.
More recently I've started with mobile development. I have paid the Android and Apple fee, I have developed my own apps with PhoneGap and Appcelerator Titanium (games for my daughters, but nothing too serious).
