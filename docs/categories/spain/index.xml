      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with politics. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s less known abroad, but it&amp;rsquo;s probably more important than the economic situation. First the government. Forget about the past. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by the end.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s in the news. Spanish Government has declared &amp;ldquo;State of Emergency&amp;rdquo;. This declaration gives special powers to the government like the ability to limit the circulation of people, commandeer things or even enter in private properties (but not homes).</description>

      <description>A few days ago I promised to explain some of my ideas to improve the civil service in Spain. Of course there is no silver bullet. Instead, as you can see the links, all the bricks are in place:</description>

      <description>Wow. It seems Wikileaks is going to publish some documents showing implication of some world leaders in corruption practices. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any other information but the Reuters piece of news.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a civil servant. Civil servants in Spain can&amp;rsquo;t be fired. Well, in fact they can be fired, but only because of extremely serious infringements, and after a complicated procedure.</description>

      <description>It turns out that I was wrong when I wrote last week&amp;rsquo;s post. Well, maybe I came to a rather good end result but for the wrong reasons:

      <description>Disclaimer. I&amp;rsquo;m not an economist or a statician, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have any governmental internal information. I&amp;rsquo;m only a spaniard.
I&amp;rsquo;ve just read a piece of news about Moody&amp;rsquo;s considering Spanish outlook stable.</description>
