      <description>Dear recruiter,&#xA;Thank you for contacting. At the moment I’m not looking for a job.&#xA;Kind regards,&#xA;Gonzalo&#xA;This is a bit impersonal.&#xA;I know. I’m sorry. The alternative is the above email for everyone.</description>

      <description>This is a story for my friend C. He didn’t know what was behind this old tweet&#xA;TFW when after two months of silence the guy contacts you, promises to send an email immediately and fails to deliver.</description>

      <description>For the last month or so I’ve been running a small experiment in my Linkedin profile. I had been receiving contacts from recruiters offering roles, and from recruiters offering developers.</description>

      <description>Dear recruiter. Don’t take it personal, but I’m not interested in the role you’re trying to recruit.&#xA;I receive lots of messages from recruiters. I get offered to participate in events so that companies can offer me new jobs.</description>

      <description>In March 2014 I was made redundant (business unit closing).&#xA;I needed to get a job and I participated in loads of selection processes. Sometimes I received feedback, sometimes not. But I remember two specific processes because I received completely different feedback from &amp;ldquo;technical tests&amp;rdquo; in a matter of days</description>

      <description>There are good recruiters. And there are bad recruiters. The good ones help you to find a job. The bad ones teach you how to look for a job.&#xA;If you are looking for a job, be sure to do just the opposite of what the bad ones do.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I went to an interview which included a pair programming session. The session was a great experience, but the result wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite as good as it should have been, because of some difficulties understanding on what was being asked.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I reported my business unit was offered for sale. Not much to report about it (I know very little and I can write even less)&#xA;Obviously, most of us in the business unit, decided to brush up our Linkedin pages and get into the job market, just in case.</description>

      <description>In my previous post I explained a great experience applying for a position. In this post I wanted to share what lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from that experience.&#xA;Selection: Be very selective about what you apply for.</description>

      <description>I wrote in my last post about lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve got from bad experiences looking for a job. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you about a good experience I had last week, how much I learnt from it, and the lessons I got from it.</description>

      <description>For some time I&amp;rsquo;ve been applying to different positions. I have two daughters and I want for them (and for me) to live in a different culture and language. After a few experiences, I&amp;rsquo;m tempted to say something about bad experiences:</description>

      <description>Sometimes I read a couple of posts not directly related, and I start to think about a topic I didn&amp;rsquo;t expected.&#xA;This time, it all started with a post of Enrique Dans.</description>
