Yesterday I explained I have attended recently a couple of courses. One of them was about [Scrum](http://www.estratecno.es/calendario/gestion-de-proyectos-con-scrum-manager-madrid-02-11-2010).
The course was very interesting, although, as I explained in the evaluation, there were times when I wished there were only one teacher instead of three.
At the end of the course, I took a test, and now I'm [Scrum Manager certified](http://scrummanager.net/perfil-de-usuario/userprofile/gonfva). I must say that the exam was quite difficult, but I don't consider myself a Scrum manager. Not even a Scrum practitioner.
Anyway, as I wrote yesterday I'm trying to define my future as a professional, and I have planned some topics in which I would like to improve, and some things I would like to do. So I decided to create a list of stories, with tasks, and planned short sprints in order to complete those stories. I even started to use [Scrum Ninja](http://scrumninja.com/). I'm the team, the product owner and the Scrum Manager. Yes, I know that isn't Scrum. Maybe "[Scrum in name only](http://legnita.wordpress.com/2010/10/22/el-agilismo-gana-adeptos/)".
But it has been very interesting to read Borja Prieto writing about [Scrum in a company](http://desencadenado.com/2010/11/usa-una-metodologia-agil-para-tu-proyecto-de-empresa.html).
