A few weeks ago, I'm not sure why, one of my daughters proposed to create a system to find cars inside garages at the shopping center. The car would locate itself using a GPS and then it would emit via radio. I told her that GPS waves don't go through the walls, and I tried to convince her to look for different approaches (like generating a wifi hotspot and using a mobile app, locate the car).

The truth is I told her it wasn't possible. I just asked her about that and she has confirmed it.

In retrospect, I think my idea is a good one. But hers is bigger. Because it doesn't work only when you know the area but you can't find the car. It works always.

Thinking about "it's not possible", I was listening today a podcast (by the way if you're into technology and entrepeneurship, [Techzing ](http://techzinglive.com/)is really good). The episode is a bit old but they were talking about emulating [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk), a guy who has several great successes proving wrong "that's not possible" from the rest of the world.

And when I've got home, reading an [article](http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/wearables/the-inside-story-of-how-the-google-glass-experiment-imploded-20150206-137shr.html), I've discovered that in the list of crazy ideas that led to Google Glass, there is a place for... GPS inside buildings.
