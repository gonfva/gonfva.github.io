6 months since last post. These have been amazing ones. Lots of work to do. Lots of challenges. We left Mantis, now working with Redmine. Learning Ruby on Rails. And learning Grails for fun and for the job.

I've been studying for another competitive examination for a civil servant positon, but I wasn't motivated. Exam is next Saturday but I don't expect to pass

I haven't had too much time to post. And I've discovered I have things to write about. Not only to practice my English. So I'm planning new posts. Stay tuned
