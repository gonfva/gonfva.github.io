A few days ago [I promised to explain](https://gonfva.blogspot.com/2010/11/civil-service-how-to-improve.html) why I chose to become a civil servant, and why I keep being one.


I was going to write about the challenge of a competitive examination, how challenges motivates me, and how my job keeps being interesting even though sometimes is a bit tough.


But then I came to ["Reasons to work"](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/11/reasons-to-work.html). Seth Godin. No more words needed.
