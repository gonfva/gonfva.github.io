I'm learning some technologies. I'm tempted to write new, but they're not new. I'm learning Ruby on Rails and mobile development. I still have to keep learning Java, and Grails, but I have a project in mind and I wanted to separate clearly from my day to day job, for lots of reasons.
Some other day I'll posts my thoughts about mobile development. But today I wanted to share that I have deployed my first application to my iTouch. It was easier to develop (it's some kind of game for my daughters to add and multiply, and it's really rough) than to deploy. But I did it.
And here goes an screenshoot (it's not a picture, but you get the point).
