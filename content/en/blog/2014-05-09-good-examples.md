I was made redundant at the end of March. It was a very stressful process but it ended up very well, as I've been in my new job for almost a month and I'm very happy.


During process, I had to work with lots of recruiters. Both from inside and outside my former company. One thing many people in the recruiting industry fail to understand is that every interaction counts. For better or for worse.


There were also people who just do their jobs. And that's OK.


There were also bad apples. I think it would be useless to point them.


But there were some very few absolutely brilliant. I remember one specific case. When each and every interaction is memorable, you know who you are going to [recommend](http://www.team-prime.com/) if asked.
