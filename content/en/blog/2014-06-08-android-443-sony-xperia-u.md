A few months ago,[ I upgraded the firmware for my Sony Xperia U](http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/firmware-upgrade-for-xperia-u-in-linux.html). It turns out that the place I used to download the firmware updates from, wasn't providing new updates, so sometime ago, I migrated to a new [source of firmware updates](http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/firmware-upgrade-for-xperia-u-in-linux.html).


I knew that Cyanogenmod was already providing Over The Air (OTA) updates. What I didn't know is that today's update would bring Android 4.4.3 when even people with a Nexus 7 has not receive Google's update yet.

Over the air. No glitches.

That's awesome.
