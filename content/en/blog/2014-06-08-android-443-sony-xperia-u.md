A few months ago, [I upgraded the firmware for my Sony Xperia U]({{< ref "2013-11-24-firmware-upgrade-for-xperia-u-in-linux-i">}}). It turns out that the place I used to download the firmware updates from, wasn't providing new updates, so sometime ago, I migrated to a new [source of firmware updates]({{< ref "2013-11-26-firmware-upgrade-for-xperia-u-in-linux">}}).


I knew that Cyanogenmod was already providing Over The Air (OTA) updates. What I didn't know is that today's update would bring Android 4.4.3 when even people with a Nexus 7 has not receive Google's update yet.

![Proof CyanogenMod installed](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Ll0IJworjnY/U5TUQ72SqLI/AAAAAAAAAp0/k5_W0W2yrCM/s1600/Screenshot_2014-06-08-22-08-57.png)

Over the air. No glitches.

That's awesome.
