## A happy user

I joined Monzo in 2016. 

![](/img/Screenshot_20230825-232526.png)_Ex-Monzo user 4956._

I even interviewed with [Tom Blomfield, former CEO of Monzo in 2014 when he was still with Anne Boden, former CEO of Starling](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2014-September/023108.html). 

I've been a satisfied Monzo user for a lot of time 

I was part of their beta program. 

I invited members of my family and a few friends, because I was genuinely happy with Monzo. 

I had an ISA with them, a joint account.

And now I'm no longer a client.

## Why

Over the summer there's been several cases with some [politician](https://news.sky.com/story/nigel-farages-bank-accounts-whats-it-all-about-and-whats-the-coutts-threshold-12915155) complaining that they were either not accepted or their account closed. 

That case was not Monzo related, so I must confess didn't pay too much attention. KYC (the obligation of knowing your customer) and AML (anti money laundering) rules are tricky, especially for banks. The processes are nuanced and they are limited in the kind of customers they can accept, and what the banks can and cannot say to the customer. 

Then, Natwest CEO had to resign because it turned out that it was true that the politician's account closure had been (partially) been because the politician's views were "at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation". 

So I started paying attention. 

Then Jeremy Hunt (Chancellor in the conservative party) declared [his application to a Monzo account had been rejected](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/09/jeremy-hunt-reveals-he-was-refused-monzo-account). Around the same time another politician on the right, [an anti-Brexit campaigner got her account closed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-66328098), and a third Tory politican and former Prime Minister [Liz Truss mentioned she couldn't campaign using Monzo](https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/liz-truss-was-refused-bank-account-for-tory-leadership-campaign/ar-AA1fwy0T).

It is perfectly reasonable that Jeremy Hunt and Liz Truss were denied an account because they are a Publicly Exposed Person. And it is possible that Gina Miller  got his account closed because she didn't declare her platform as a political party and when Monzo discovered it, they closed it. Of course, I might have missed other cases on the left as well.

It also possible that as in Natwest case, there are views accepted and views not accected by Monzo.

Then it came a [paywalled](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/08/01/bank-monzo-jeremy-hunt-refused-account-tories-evil/) piece in the Telegraph with some quotes in Monzo's employee's chat. And then it was more clear which one of the two was: not AML and KYC but yet another instance of "inappropiate views". 

## On brand

Don't get me wrong. There is a lot of drama in company chats. But comments like that should have triggered a private converstation between a manager, an employee and maybe even the compliance and HR departments. I am pretty sure that if somebody in the team had mentioned the religion or the ehtnicity or the sexual orientation of a client or prospective clients, that conversation would have happened. 

But if it is the opinions of a client... then these actions seem they are **on brand**, as a smart, otherwise nice, and sensible former Monzo employee said on Twitter.

Let me reiterate. It is perfectly reasonable to refuse an account because of financial regulations. And data protection make it difficult for the bank to clarify.

But there is also the possibility that all those actions like with Natwest before "at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation". 

And it is clear that Monzo's employees think those politicians shouldn't be part of the public sphere. They shouldn't be in politics. They are evil.

##Â Personal brand

Then bye. 

From Tuesday 12th September 2023, I'm no longer a Monzo client. My personal brand don't allow me to work with a bank that considers that politicians on the right are not allowed to be in politics. They probably can do it legally, but I don't want to use that bank.

I'm sure if some employee (or ex-employee) reads this, they might think "your loss". 

It is in fact my loss. Monzo's app is better, more rounded, (although on banking with others I've discover some things that enjoy on those others compared to Monzo)

But I want to appeal to them, and in fact to everybody. 

This is not about Tory or other right wing politicians politicians. 

It is about you and me, and about leaving outside the system people we don't agree with.

And this time it was right wing politicians.

But next time it might left wing politicians. 

Or because Bitcoin is dangerous (and I'm sure AML regulations and crypto touch in many points)
