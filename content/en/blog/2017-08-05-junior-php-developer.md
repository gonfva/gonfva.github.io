![](/img/1*pi12eWmXb5TOZprbCsovaQ.png)For the last month or so I’ve been running a small experiment in my Linkedin profile.
I had been receiving contacts from recruiters offering roles, and from recruiters offering developers.
I’m not quite interested in any of those services. Frankly, the job market for technology is a crazy house. Companies recruiting on readers of “Cracking the coding interview” instead of [culture](https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/891352583511482368). Recruiters literally spamming or even sometimes harassing. And “candidates” either jumping for salary or just “getting a job”.

Anyway, too many contacts from recruiters, as many people in tech. At one point, I got tired. So I decided to change my title in LinkedIn to make it less attractive.

**No offence to PHP**, but I transformed myself into a Junior PHP developer. With the Junior part I wanted to stress I don’t have any hiring/buying power. With PHP I hoped to make it uncool and I expected it to be in low demand.

The first week I got really excited. Only a couple of recruiters and none to offer developers.

But now I can say it was Summer effect. Contacts have returned to previous level.

Yes I keep receiving offers from recruiters “to see if I can help Basement Crowd scale talent quickly”. I didn’t deceive them.

But more importantly, it seems **PHP is in high demand**, guys.
