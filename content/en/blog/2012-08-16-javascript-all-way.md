These days I'm playing with NodeJS.<br />And today I was thinking about the fundamental change in Javascript.<br />A few years ago it was a darn language for the web.<br />Now someone could query a database using Javascript (<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a>), create the server portion of a web application using Javascipt(<a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>), create the browser portion of a web application using pure and fast Javascript, and even create a pure mobile interface using Javascipt (<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/" target="_blank">Appcelerator Titanium</a>).<br />Google has&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;a language trying to replace Javascript called <a href="http://www.dartlang.org/" target="_blank">Google Dart</a>, but I seriously doubt Google will succeed.
