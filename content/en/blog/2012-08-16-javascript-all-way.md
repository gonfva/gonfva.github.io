These days I'm playing with NodeJS.<br />And today I was thinking about the fundamental change in Javascript.<br />A few years ago it was a darn language for the web.<br />Now someone could query a database using Javascript ([CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)), create the server portion of a web application using Javascipt([NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)), create the browser portion of a web application using pure and fast Javascript, and even create a pure mobile interface using Javascipt ([Appcelerator Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/)).<br />Google has&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;a language trying to replace Javascript called [Google Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/), but I seriously doubt Google will succeed.
