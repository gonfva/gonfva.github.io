Yes. It's been three months since I wrote my [previous post](/posts/2008-11-19-yahoo-declining-star-ii). When I started to write this blog I knew it could end like other blogs I have started. But I didn't think I was going to stop writing so fast.

In fact I have [some other blog](http://noigo.blogspot.com/) I write from time to time. It's just that I'm not too persistent. I start things, because I have cool ideas. But I don't have the guts to fight for them.

Anyway last Monday I went to a level test for an English course. I hope it helps me to achieve my goal of being able to work in English. And I hope it also helps me to keep this blog rolling.
