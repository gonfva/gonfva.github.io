In the last couple of months I’ve been able to see a growing trend with Snapchat. More and more people I follow in Twitter are testing Snapchat waters.

Around a month ago, I installed the app, started registering, think twice…

… and uninstalled.

Now, I’ve discovered that Snapchat is really a thing outside teenagers.

And you know what?

I don’t care.

I’m going to miss this one.

I’ve been an early adopter in many trends. But I guess I’m getting old.

For me it’s surprising that I’m getting better signal to noise ratio from good old mail.
