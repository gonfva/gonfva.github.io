You know something is broken with copyright when:
<br /><br />

<ul><li>You buy a "Barbie and three Musqueteers" DVD and you can't play in your DVD player because it's piracy protected. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But..</span>.
<br /><br />
You download the same film from a P2P network, save to a CD and you can play it everywhere.</li><br /><li>You can't install the Windows Vista that came with your computer, on a VirtualBox over a Linux box, because it refuses to activate. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But...</span>
<br /><br />
You can download a file from a P2P network that contains 4 versions of Windows 7 (from starter to ultimate) that will happily install on VirtualBox, will activate and will update flawlessly.</li></ul>
<br /><br />
I'm sick of this.
