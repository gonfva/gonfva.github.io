In two weeks I will be working in London. I know I was expecting to continue my last post about [Spring persistence](http://gonfva.blogspot.com.es/2012/10/crash-course-on-spring-mvc-transactions.html). I have lots of things to write about the incredible experience of finding a job abroad and relocating.


But as you'll imagine, I'm quite busy. I'll try to post before starting in my new job, but I don't promise anything. Thank you. Each and every one of you.
