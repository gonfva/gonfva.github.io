While <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.com.es/2012/08/a-great-experience-applying-to-position.html" target="_blank">applying to a position</a> a few days ago, I received an assignment trying to test my coding style.
<br /><br />
IMO, assignments are quite a good way to get a peek on the coding style of someone. They are easy&nbsp;programming&nbsp;tasks that show if somebody is able to code (<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html" target="_blank">it seems many of us can't</a>), and what's his/her style.
<br /><br />
Another similar tool would be online testing web applications such as <a href="http://codility.com/" target="_blank">codility</a>.&nbsp;My opinion of codility is mixed. I think it's a good way to test, but some of the assignments are already on the Internet, and doing a bit of research you can find some of them. Besides, focusing on a fixed time frame (one hour), it's more prone to errors on the&nbsp;assignee.
<br /><br />
Anyway, no method is perfect, and I've&nbsp;discovered<a href="https://github.com/alexwibowo/Robot" target="_blank"> the assignment I was given was already solved on the Internet</a>. For the record, with due respect, I think <a href="https://github.com/alexwibowo/Robot/tree/master/src/main/java/au/com/anz/robot/command" target="_blank">googled solution is overkill</a>. But you can see there the specific assignment.
<br /><br />
When I received the test, first thing I thought was about the programming language. I was allowed to code in any language, but the position I had applied was Ruby based. I was more comfortable doing it in Java, but wanted to do it in Ruby. What if I wasn't able to do it right in Ruby? Better to do it right first, and then to try to show the point I am at in Ruby.
<br /><br />
So I did it both in <a href="https://github.com/gonfva/assignments/tree/master/gfvRobotJava" target="_blank">Java</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/gonfva/assignments/tree/master/gfv_robot_ruby" target="_blank">Ruby</a>.
