While [applying to a position]({{< ref "2012-08-13-a-great-experience-applying-to-position">}}) a few days ago, I received an assignment trying to test my coding style.


IMO, assignments are quite a good way to get a peek on the coding style of someone. They are easy programming tasks that show if somebody is able to code ([it seems many of us can't](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/why-cant-programmers-program.html)), and what's his/her style.


Another similar tool would be online testing web applications such as [codility](http://codility.com/). My opinion of codility is mixed. I think it's a good way to test, but some of the assignments are already on the Internet, and doing a bit of research you can find some of them. Besides, focusing on a fixed time frame (one hour), it's more prone to errors on the assignee.


Anyway, no method is perfect, and I've discovered[ the assignment I was given was already solved on the Internet](https://github.com/alexwibowo/Robot). For the record, with due respect, I think [googled solution is overkill](https://github.com/alexwibowo/Robot/tree/master/src/main/java/au/com/anz/robot/command). But you can see there the specific assignment.


When I received the test, first thing I thought was about the programming language. I was allowed to code in any language, but the position I had applied was Ruby based. I was more comfortable doing it in Java, but wanted to do it in Ruby. What if I wasn't able to do it right in Ruby? Better to do it right first, and then to try to show the point I am at in Ruby.


So I did it both in [Java](https://github.com/gonfva/assignments/tree/master/gfvRobotJava) and in [Ruby](https://github.com/gonfva/assignments/tree/master/gfv_robot_ruby).
