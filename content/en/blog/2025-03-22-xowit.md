I'm always full of ideas.

But they never go beyond ideas.

Sometimes I would buy a domain and promise myself that "this is the one". And the list of domains grows.

## Experiment

But this year I've decided I'm simply going to [experiment](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7424432804). I've lowered the level of what I want to do.

My first experiment is about reading. I read too little. But I no longer want to ship the [Netflix of books](https://gonzalo.f-v.es/blog/2015-12-12-the-netflix-of-books/). I just want to help myself use the wonderful [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). And if it is helpful for others, great.

## AI

However. It is not only that I have lowered expectations. The level of what we (I) can do has increased. [AI is a multiplier](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7424479812). My first experiment has made user of [Grok](https://x.com/i/grok), [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [Claude code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview). From refining my idea, to writing the "copy" (text), to styles, to code.

I've passed all the usual steps using AI. "OMG, this is frigging incredible", to "no, claude-code, you cannot fix something just by putting a delay", to "how the heck can you have copies of the same file in two different places and call it refactoring!!", to "let me fix this project until I've got something I can understand", back again to the vibe coding of "just change the styling of the project to make it visually more appealing" and wait for a commit that touches 20 files and makes an incredible job.

Not only that. There is a bit of prompt engineering to get book recommendations. A very cheap model. Just to experiment without breaking the bank.

AIs are great. And if you're not playing with them (yes, you, the non-technical guy and also, yes, you the technical guy), you're missing a lot.

## Lo and behold

And this is the result:

[Xowit](https://xowit.com)

Xowit helps you get book recommendations **from** your Kindle **into** your Kindle.

Please, play with it and ping me. Tell me how it works. What do you like? What you don't like?

## A bit of embarrassment

Xowit probably will have bugs, the aesthetics are not great, the recommendation engine is quite simple.


<blockquote>"Yes. We should read more. But why only Kindle? Why don't you let me select which books I like, which ones I don't? The idea has so much potential. Gonzalo, you did a poor job."</blockquote>

You know the drill about you should be embarrassed by a first version. But I will paste the original author of the sentence.

## The gory details

For those more into tech. Cloudflare (no, not AWS). D1 (not RDS, maybe Opensearch in the future). R2 (not S3). Svelte (not NextJS/React). OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini`.


## Just one more thing

This is only the first experiment. Yes, Q1 2025 is over.

But Q2 2025 is about to start!!!
