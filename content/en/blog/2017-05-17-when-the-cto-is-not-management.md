Tech startup founded by non-tech founders. Founders know little about technology, so they hire a CTO like they would hire an accountant. CTO is not part of management. Technology gets isolated. #### Choose your CTO… and then trust her

A friend of mine got hired as a CTO three years ago. What started as an exciting position setting up the whole team, [technology](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/technology) and processes for the company, ended up sidelined, micromanaged, with no responsibility over the team, and no decision over the technology.

I’ve discovered his case is not uncommon.

A few days ago I was chatting with some other friend. She mentioned the company she had been working for a few years ago. The CTO was also fired, and now developers are “properly managed”.

Then I remembered that other [startup](https://hackernoon.com/tagged/startup), with the VP of Engineering that resigned in less than 6 months because the technology department was considered an assembly line.

After the chat, when I got home, I saw in LinkedIn a contact from that small startup I interviewed for three years ago. Again CTO, technically very good, and with lots of experience is now “Principal developer” (he has been demoted).

I can see a pattern:

> Tech startup founded by non-tech founders.
> Founders know little about technology, so they **hire** a CTO like they would hire an accountant.
> The CTO is only part of one team: technology. She is not part of management.
> The CTO doesn’t sell. The CTO communicates with her team but not with the rest of the company. The CTO doesn’t manage expectations. So technology gets isolated into a support department, not the driving force of the company. Technology is perceived as a very expensive cost centre.
> Eventually, when technology doesn’t provide the desired results, a stronger hand is needed. A whip. And if there is still a CTO, she will be demoted, or fired or sidetracked until he leaves.A CTO is not a senior developer. CTOs need to have one leg in technology and the other in management. It’s not only programming. It is discussing pros and cons, planning long-term, creating a team, mixing strategy and product, managing priorities and expectations, understanding finance, and communicating across boundaries.

Your CTO has to be part of your management team.
