I'm planning to make a newbie post about rvm, bundler and the rest. But just in case you're starting with ubuntu, here comes a piece of advice.
<br /><br />
There is some controversy about editor to use for ruby. Some people prefer <a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/06/28/tmux-the-terminal-multiplexer/" target="_blank">Vim+tmux</a>, which seems the more standard. Other people prefer TextMate on MacOSX and Redcar on Ubuntu. I must say that I prefer vi to emacs, but for the time being I prefer Redcar to vim. In the future this may change, but not at the moment. Anyway, one of typical topics when migrating from Linux Mint is "how the h*ll do I anchor an application to the Unity bar?". Well, in the <a href="http://askubuntu.com/a/84913/19175" target="_blank">case of Redcar, here is the answer</a>.
<br /><br />
Side question: "Why the h*ll are you leaving Linux Mint?"
<br /><br />
Anyway, back to more interesting topics. If you are a Rails developer, you should be using RVM. How do you use RVM in Ubuntu. Two tips:
<br /><br />
First. Forget about apt-get install rvm, and if you are reading this too late, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9056008/installed-ruby-1-9-3-with-rvm-but-command-line-doesnt-show-ruby-v/9056395#9056395" target="_blank">go here</a>.<br />Second. If you are using gnome terminal, <a href="https://rvm.io/integration/gnome-terminal/" target="_blank">read this</a>.
<br /><br />
