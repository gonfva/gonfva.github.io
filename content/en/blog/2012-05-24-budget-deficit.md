Disclaimer: I'm talking about public data. I don't have any unpublished data.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In Spain there is some buzz recently about tax increases&nbsp;approved&nbsp;on December 30th. The government had changed and the new one said it was necessary to raise taxes because data said budget deficit where 8% GDP. The commitment was to finalize 2011 with a 6% GDP, from 9.2 previous year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>OK. Here is my take. We will end 2011 with more than 9% GDP. And here is my reasoning.</div><div><br /></div><div>From what I know, public data about budget deficit appears on [this page](http://www.igae.pap.meh.es/sitios/igae/es-ES/InformesCuentas/Informes/Paginas/publicaciones.aspx). As of January 10th, the more recent data are for federal government data (Estado) the November 2011 data, and for all public administrations, 2Q2011.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>With November data for the federal government, you get a deficit of 52385 million euros for the 2011. But, in my opinion, to get the whole picture you have to take into account a twelve month period. Adding up December 2010, we would be talking of 64306 million euros. Around 6% GDP vs 4.8%GDP expected.</div><div><br /></div><div>Similarly, data for all public administrations. Last data available is 2Q2011, with a deficit of 41348 for the 2011. But again you need a twelve month period. Adding 3Q2010 and 4Q2010, you get a total&nbsp;amount of 98283 million euros. Yes. At 2Q2011 the twelve month deficit was greater than at 2Q2010 (although&nbsp;on a percentage of the GDP it was a bit smaller).</div><div><br /></div><div>Until we get updated data, deficit will end 2011 over 9% GDP.


EDITED (31/01/2011): It seems that public data [3Q2011 for all public administrations is out](http://www.igae.pap.meh.es/sitios/igae/es-ES/InformesCuentas/Informes/Documents/Cap-Trim/3T%20AAPP.pdf). 93786 million euros for a twelve month period. Using a GDP for 2011 of&nbsp;&nbsp;1058701 million euros, deficit was 8,86% GDP.</div>
