I didn't know about [object calisthenics](http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2012/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf). They are a set of rules to help develop better:

1. One level of indentation per method<
2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword
3. Wrap all primitives and Strings
4. First class collections
5. One dot per line
6. Don’t abbreviate
7. Keep all entities small
8. No classes with more than two instance variables
9. No getters/setters/properties


Some of them are a must, with some others I have some doubts. But the point 2 is so intriguing I have to test it.
