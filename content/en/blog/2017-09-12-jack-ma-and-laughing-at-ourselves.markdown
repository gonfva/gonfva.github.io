I must confess he’s always amazing me. He’s a guy that it’s used to being rejected. He even has mentioned he applied to KFC with other 23 people and he was the only rejected. Imagine the feeling of being the worst of 24 people applying for KFC!!! (no offence).

His latest video really gave me goose-bumps.

And he puts himself in the line.

It is obvious he’s aware of his limitations: he’s not Michael Jackson. He is not just trying to imitate Michael Jackson. He’s providing his employees with a party they won’t forget.

One may be tempted to think he’s a clown and he wants to be in the limelight. Maybe he’s.

I prefer to think he’s just a guy that hasn’t got tired of dreaming.

Sometimes I would really want to embrace failure and embarrassment.
