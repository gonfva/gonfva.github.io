A few days ago I was listening a podcast about[ the importance of being able to tell a story](http://thestartupchat.com/ep060/), not a lists of jobs when asked about you.

In a spirit of practising, I’m going to share two stories of my early life that affects who I am.

First, my family says I started to speak a bit late. But when I started to speak I did it almost like an adult.

Second, I wear glasses, but when I was a child I didn’t have a bedside table. Throwing the book to the floor after reading was OK, but not the glasses. Getting out of bed was “the way it is”. So I invented and built a clunky lift for taking my glasses to the floor.

Looking back, I can picture that kid in many of my attitudes.

Today I cannot remain silent in a working environment even if I feel my English is not good enough. But I speak much less than I should.

And today, confronted with a “that’s the way it is”, I tend to look for a different way.

You may be tempted to think the first one is a curse and the second is a blessing.

Well, I somehow agree.

But speaking less helps me listening more.

And there is almost always a different way, but sometimes it’s difficult to know if it’s better.

I haven’t change too much.
