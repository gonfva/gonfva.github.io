I wrote yesterday about <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.com/2010/11/civil-service-in-spain-job-security.html">why job security is a good mechanism to protect civil service</a> from corruption. But I also explained that it's a mechanism that makes difficult to punish slackers. <br />That wouldn't be a serious problem if there were mechanism to reward people who do right. And the truth is that there aren't. The salary has a variable part but could be more or less explained as "if you come to work twice a week in the afternoon, you get it". Not very rewarding to productivity. <br /><span style="font-style:italic;">If you come to work but don't do anything, you get paid. If you come to work in the afternoon, but don't do anything, you get paid more.</span><br />Of course money isn't everything. At least in my case, a challenging environment is a great part of the deal. But here again civil service is difficult. It's slow and innovations are difficult to pass through.<br />It's surprising that people do anything. But, truth to be told, there are lots of people who work. There are all sort of tricks, but in general, people work.<br />Tomorrow, I'll try to explain additional ideas.
