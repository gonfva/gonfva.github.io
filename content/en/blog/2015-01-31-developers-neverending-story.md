A year ago I vaguely new something about <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>. Today I'm not an expert, but I'm reasonably proficient in Scala, with some experience in <a href="http://liftweb.net/">Lift</a>, <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/">Slick</a>, and some incursions in <a href="http://akka.io/">akka</a>. I knew almost nothing about devops, and now I use almost everyday <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">ansible</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I'm far from an expert in any of those technologies. But I work with all of them.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Not bad for a year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>However, as a developer the amount of effort you need to keep reasonably up-to-date is huge. These days I find myself trying to keep learning the mentioned technologies, but also get a grip of others.&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>Akka is nice, but about <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> and <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> (as a way to, broadly speaking, distribute load. Yes, I know they are completely different beasts).&nbsp;</li><li>Lift is an interesting concept, but what about going the other end with <a href="http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/#Twitter's standard libraries-Futures">Futures</a>-based Twitter-sponsored lightning fast <a href="http://finatra.info/">Finatra</a>?&nbsp;</li><li>Jquery is OK, but now I'm reading about Google sponsored <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and Facebook's <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is great, but did you know about <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">foundation</a>?.&nbsp;</li><li>Granted <a href="https://gradle.org/">gradle</a> is great (much better than SBT in my inexperienced opinion, even though after Pivotal shuting down their Groovy development, the future is a bit uncertain), But did you know anything about <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> (again different beasts, bower is only for front-end technologies).</li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>Argh.</div><div><br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
