A year ago I vaguely new something about [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/). Today I'm not an expert, but I'm reasonably proficient in Scala, with some experience in [Lift](http://liftweb.net/), [Slick](http://slick.typesafe.com/), and some incursions in [akka](http://akka.io/). I knew almost nothing about devops, and now I use almost everyday [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/), [ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
<div>
</div><div>I'm far from an expert in any of those technologies. But I work with all of them.&nbsp;</div><div>
</div><div>Not bad for a year.&nbsp;</div><div>
</div><div>However, as a developer the amount of effort you need to keep reasonably up-to-date is huge. These days I find myself trying to keep learning the mentioned technologies, but also get a grip of others.&nbsp;</div><div><ul><li>Akka is nice, but about [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/) (as a way to, broadly speaking, distribute load. Yes, I know they are completely different beasts).&nbsp;</li><li>Lift is an interesting concept, but what about going the other end with [Futures](http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/#Twitter's standard libraries-Futures)-based Twitter-sponsored lightning fast [Finatra](http://finatra.info/)?&nbsp;</li><li>Jquery is OK, but now I'm reading about Google sponsored [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is great, but did you know about [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)?.&nbsp;</li><li>Granted [gradle](https://gradle.org/) is great (much better than SBT in my inexperienced opinion, even though after Pivotal shuting down their Groovy development, the future is a bit uncertain), But did you know anything about [bower](http://bower.io/) (again different beasts, bower is only for front-end technologies).</li></ul></div><div>
