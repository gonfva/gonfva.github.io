I tend to listen <a href="http://techzinglive.com/">Techzing podcast</a>. It's a podcast about very different topics, recorded by two geeks, (or developers, and entrepeneurs). I don't remember when I started listening them. I do remember I started because I wanted to practice English and it was great (Justin is an Englishman and Jason is American). Soon I forgot why: they were great by themselves. The topics are very diverse from Technology, Entrepenurship, Politics (Loom and Gloom Report), Education, Genetics...
<br /><br />
I listen them while commuting, and I was a couple of months behind.&nbsp;However, I just listened <a href="http://techzinglive.com/page/1141/200-tz-wives-setting-the-record-straight">episode 200</a>: techzing wives.
<br /><br />
And it's simply the best. I couldn't help but laugh in many different parts of the episode.
<br /><br />
I guess that episode is not very interesting for a newcomer. But I'm sure that for most of their regular listeners it has been a great experience to listen to our own wives in the voices of three complete&nbsp;estrangers.
