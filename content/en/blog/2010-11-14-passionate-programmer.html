The last few weeks have been really intense with respect to my career. I've attended two courses, given some presentations, launched a few projects at work, and read some books. Sometimes I've been under a lot of self-imposed pressure, but overall I've learned a lot of things.
<br /><br />
One of the books I've read has been really enlightening. It has been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Passionate-Programmer-Remarkable-Development-Pragmatic/dp/1934356344/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1289752038&sr=8-1">The passionate Programmer</a>. It's a book I wish I'd read years ago, and I'm tempted to buy a few copies and give them to some of my coworkers.
<br /><br />
Initially I thought it was to late for me, but as times passes, I'm more and more convinced that it's not too late. I don't know what future will bring but I hope I'm still able to influence it.
