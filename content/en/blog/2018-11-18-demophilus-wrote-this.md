These days I’m reading a fascinating book on Roman History called [SPQR](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28789711-spqr). And I’ve discovered Roman History is full of lessons for today’s world.

As a small token, a line from [Plautus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautus), a Roman writer, that appeared in some of his books.

> Demophilus wrote this, Plautus barbarised it.

As Mary Beard, the author of SPQR, explains, the sentence was a clever challenge.

For people of Greek origin, it was a way to mock Romans, that didn’t bring anything new.

But to Romans, it suggested that maybe Greeks could consider Romans the same way Romans considered others: **barbarians**.

And on that path of “maybe we are barbarians to those whom we consider barbarians”, it connected with the “**us vs them**” in a [different book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36014145-behave). Our brain is probably shaped to group people. People can be “us” regarding one category and “them” regarding other. But when thinking in terms of “them”, it’s difficult to establish a connection.

They are the enemy. They are the barbarians.

In a world of increasing division-on-its-way-to-chasm, we are barbarians to those we consider barbarians
