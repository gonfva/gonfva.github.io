Imagine youÂ´re a Member of&nbsp;Parliament. And you have decided you are not going to give your support to something. And then you get a group of people protesting against you.
<div>
You would say. "Well, nothing new"


... calling you&nbsp;cockroach&nbsp;and threatening to kill you.&nbsp;</div><div>
</div><div>You would say something like "Well, you know. People sometimes say things they don't really think."</div><div>
</div><div>... at the street in front of your home.&nbsp;</div><div>
</div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tZH11RhdrrI" width="560"></iframe>
<div>
</div><div>... or even inside your building and[ hitting the door of your flat while your children are inside and you are not there](http://www.levante-emv.com/comunitat-valenciana/2013/03/20/gonzalez-pons-inaceptable-aporreen-casa-hay-ninos/983345.html).


I'm very worried. For several reasons</div><div><ul><li>They are Member of&nbsp;Parliament. They are representing thousands of people.</li><li>MP are being&nbsp;harassed&nbsp;to make them vote something different (at best). Not&nbsp;trying&nbsp;to convince with reasons, but with fear.</li><li>They are being&nbsp;harassed&nbsp;not only at the&nbsp;Parliament&nbsp;or giving a speech in some random place. But at their homes. Threatening their&nbsp;neighbors&nbsp;with "it's not safe to live near an MP".&nbsp;Threatening&nbsp;their families.</li><li>The&nbsp;rhetoric&nbsp;(crockoachs, we are going to kill, you don't deserve living) shows the "objectification of the enemy". The enemy is everybody who does not think the same.</li><li>I hadn't heard the word&nbsp;[escrache](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escrache)&nbsp;until a month ago. But it is another symptom of a trend.&nbsp;It is not something new. It is not something big. It's some [little thing here](http://www.madridiario.es/2012/Diciembre/madrid/225459/tienda-guillotina-madrid-unica-europa.html16). [That comic strip there](http://www.elmundo.es/blogs/elmundo/elblogdesantiagogonzalez/2012/12/18/afinen-la-punteria.html). A [little piece of news over there](http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130208/rc-grupo-anarquista-asume-bomba-201302081229.html).&nbsp;</li></ul>And last but not least, because the unemployment rate in Spain&nbsp;is over 26% for the general population and over 55% for people under 25 y.o.


Some people say "Yes it's violence&nbsp;<b>but</b>...". Yes. Violence is justified against people who think something different. And even&nbsp;[other members of&nbsp;Parliament&nbsp;support this form of pressure](https://www.facebook.com/alberto.garzon.espinosa/posts/435341839891927).


However, every cloud has a silver lining. There are other MP that&nbsp;[oppose to this trend](http://rosadiez.net/2013/03/25/no/).
