More than six years ago [I started this blog](http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/what-is-this.html). I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.


Four years later[ I came to London](http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/relocating-to-london.html) and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.


But it is not. I really think blogging is a good way to improve your written expression, to clarify your thoughts. And sometimes what you tell is worthwhile for others. It is not specifically related to speaking a different language (but it also helps that).


So my New Year's resolution is to write more often. Just to practice. And hoping this could be of use for somebody.


Happy New Year.
