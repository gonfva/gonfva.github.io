More than six years ago <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/what-is-this.html">I started this blog</a>. I wanted to practice my English so that I would improve it.
<br /><br />
Four years later<a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/relocating-to-london.html"> I came to London</a> and sort of abandoned it, thinking that working in an English speaking environment would be enough to practice.
<br /><br />
But it is not. I really think blogging is a good way to improve your written expression, to clarify your thoughts. And sometimes what you tell is worthwhile for others. It is not specifically related to speaking a different language (but it also helps that).
<br /><br />
So my New Year's resolution is to write more often. Just to practice. And hoping this could be of use for somebody.
<br /><br />
Happy New Year.
