I didn't know about [object calisthenics](http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2012/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf). They are a set of rules to help develop better:



<blockquote class="tr_bq"><blockquote class="tr_bq">1. One level of indentation per method</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">2. Don’t use the ELSE keyword&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">3. Wrap all primitives and Strings4. First class collections</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">5. One dot per line</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">6. Don’t abbreviate</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">7. Keep all entities small</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">8. No classes with more than two instance variables</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">9. No getters/setters/properties</blockquote></blockquote>Some of them are a must, with some others I have some doubts. But the point 2 is so&nbsp;intriguing&nbsp;I have to test it.
