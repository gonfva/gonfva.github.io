Wow. It seems Wikileaks is going to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AN5HL20101124">publish some documents showing implication of some world leaders in corruption practices</a>. I don't have any other information but the Reuters piece of news.
<br /><br />
I wouldn't have brought it to this blog if it weren't for the last paragraph of the first page:
<br /><br />
<blockquote>Two of the sources said Assange has also made the documents available to at least two other European publications -- the newspapers El Pais of Spain and Le Monde of France.</blockquote>
<br /><br />
That would suggest that government leaders implicated could be Spaniards or Frenchmen. Don't know if it's true.
<br /><br />
But watching financial markets regarding peripheral European bonds I can't help thinking that this could have connections with Spanish politics.
