I've been on holidays, and I've had some spare time to stop and think.
<br /><br />
Last couple of months have been special. Some events have affected profoundly.
<br /><br />
One of those events has been the death of a collegue. Antonio was a young man. At least young for me, since he was in his early 40's, only a few years older than me. Antonio was a nice guy. I remember him laughing a lot of times. Antonio was smart, talented, and on a technical level he always had a different perspective too. As it turns out, it wasn't enough for him.
<br /><br />
The second event was reading this <a href="http://www.8164.org/complacency/">inspiring post about how easy is to let your life flow</a>. While reading that article I felt like as I was looking at my life. I work better under presure. I want to point a couple of examples. One, while studying <a href="http://www.ibo.org/">International Baccalaureate</a>. I worked a lot, learnt a lot and enjoy a lot. I felt alive. The other was while preparing the competitive examination to become a Civil Servant. My two daughters were one year old. My wife took care of them while I managed to study (a lot) after work, concentrating in the preparation while in the same house there were two little girls playing (and screaming ;D). But when there's nothing challenging, life flows.
<br /><br />
I have a wonderful family that gives me a reason to live. I love my wife. I love my daughters. I don't feel depressed.
<br /><br />
But I feel that, most of the time, life flows and I'm carried rather walking. And I want to be walking. And I need new challenges.
<br /><br />
The start of a new scholar year is a good time to plan them. They won't be huge challenges. But by writing them here I hope I can achieve them.
<br /><br />
So here are they:<br /><ul><li><b>Books</b>. I used to read a lot of books. I love reading. But I haven't been doing recently. Today I've received <a href="http://www.gentedigital.es/blogs/gentedeinternet/32/blog-post/2383/101-libros-para-leer-antes-de-morir/">a list of essential novels</a> and I've discovered I haven't read a lot of them. So I'm planning to read at least <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tfv_BSQr4aHx8GPY6rAoGiQ&single=true&gid=0&output=html">20 books of that list I haven't read yet</a> until August 2010. That doesn't look too much. But I want to set some number.</li><br /><li><b>Blog</b>. I like blogging, but I don't think I have too many interesting things to say. However, I want to practice my English. And I think this is an excellent way to do it. That's why I'm going to try to post once a week until August 2010.</li><br /><li><b>Software developing</b>. I like software developing, but in my current position I do a more managerial work. So I'm going to develop at home. The problem with this resolution is that it's not easy to quantify. Should I read new techniques?. I already do. Should I write X lines of code?. Oh c'mon. I'm not such a moron. So this resolution is to use three hours a week to develop something, probably some kind of web application to scratch a personal itch.</li></ul><br />I'll try to post my progress on these challenges in Twitter. Although the blog posting is easier to check here.
