Yes. It's been three months since I wrote my <a href="http://gonfva.blogspot.com/2008/11/yahoo-declining-star-ii.html">previous post</a>. When I started to write this blog I knew it could end like other blogs I have started. But I didn't think I was going to stop writing so fast.
<br /><br />
In fact I have <a href="http://noigo.blogspot.com/">some other blog</a> I write from time to time. It's just that I'm not too persistent. I start things, because I have cool ideas. But I don't have the guts to fight for them.
<br /><br />
Anyway last Monday I went to a level test for an English course. I hope it helps me to achieve my goal of being able to work in English. And I hope it also helps me to keep this blog rolling.
