Starting a blog it’s a difficult task. It’s not nearly as difficult as keeping
updating it, of course.
<br /><br />
I have started a couple of blogs.
<br /><br />
Both are abandoned.
<br /><br />
Not a good track.
<br /><br />
Will this blog be different? I don’t know if I’ll continue updating this. But I
know for sure this blog is different now.
<br /><br />
The first difference is that I’m writing it in English. The reason I’m doing it,
is because writing in English it’s an exercise for me.
<br /><br />
I’m an Spaniard, I live at Spain, and my mother tongue is Spanish.
<br /><br />
I can read pretty well in English. But I’m not able to express myself in
English, mostly by lack of practice. And I need it.
<br /><br />
Therefore, I must practice. And I’d thank you when you point me to something
unclear or incorrect.
<br /><br />
The second difference is that this not going a specialised blog on a certain
topic. This is a blog about me and my thoughts. Probably it isn’t interesting
for anybody besides me. But it serves “to scratch my itch”, to verbalize what I
think, and better, to do it in English.
