I read it first on
<a

Google Operating System</a
, but I haven't seen too much buzz on the blogs I follow. <br /><br />
For me today is the day <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</ahas
definitively died. <br /><br />

Maybe it was long before</a>
from a pure bussiness view. There hasn't been anything new since Skype's
adquisition by Ebay. And my contacts on Skype were offline most of the time
lately. <br /><br />
But from now I don't have any reason to even install Skype. Of course, there
were a lot of others programs apart from Skype.
<br /><br />
But from today I can open Gmail, and
<a

chat with video and voice from the browser</a
. And my contacts are already there. <br /><br />
But I think the movement hits further than Skype. I'm afraid
