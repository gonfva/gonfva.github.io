  Today I was reading this article about [excuses from banks for crap services](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurengensler/2016/07/13/online-bank-account-balance-overdraft-fees/?ss=personalfinance#304621b015a1). Then I got to this sentence:


> Consumers need to understand that the balance you see is not necessarily your actual available balance because there are so many moving partsNo. Consumers don’t need to understand anything like that. It is your job to simplify things. And you even fail to recognise it.

[I’ve mentioned it before](https://medium.com/@gonfva/banks-and-users-a62b495a533f#.lm38bnfx7). I have worked for highly formalised organisations and I know from inside that sometimes it’s very difficult to disrupt our own organisation. To think from the user perspective, from its needs. And try to come up with innovative solutions that simplify users’ life. Make the user love you.

But there is no other way.

Because if you don’t follow that path, [there will be others that will](http://thefinancialbrand.com/59779/digital-banking-branch-channel-switching/?utm_content=buffera6a30&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer?ref=upflow.co).
