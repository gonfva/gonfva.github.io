Sometimes I read a couple of posts not directly related, and I start to think about a topic I didn't expected.
<br /><br />
This time, it all started with a post of Enrique Dans.
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.enriquedans.com/2008/11/redes-sociales-profesionales-%C2%BFsabe-tu-empresa-que-te-quieres-ir.html%E2%80%9D">Enrique asked what happens when your company is looking for new employees</a>, enters a professional social network like Linkedin to find the right person for the job, and discover that you have a completely updated profile, showing that in a way youâ€™re "in the market".
<br /><br />
Enrique's post is very interesting as whole, but I kept thinking about what Enrique calls "the switchers": people who change from one work to another, and then to another, always looking for a better salary. And then I remember another tactic used by some of my coworkers: coming to my boss, telling him that he/she had and offer from another company and they were leaving, and getting a better salary for not leaving.
<br /><br />
For me, jobs are more than salary, but I always thought it was a bad game for the companies, as they were rewarding the people less faithful.
<br /><br />
I think it would be better to pay your employees what you think you can AND should pay. Trying to "retain talent" before "talent" is even concious he/she can leave, or before he/she is wanting to leave.
<br /><br />
Those were my thoughts when turned up <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/11/the-9010-rule-o.html%E2%80%9D">Seth Godin</a> writing a key thought<br /><blockquote>If talent is so important that you are betting the company on it, why aren't you actually investing in finding and retaining that talent?</blockquote>
<br /><br />
May I ask you to read it again?
<br /><br />
Ten years ago, job offers came in many cases mouth to ear or from the newspaper. And a new employee was very similar to another new employee. Sort of meat at a butcher's. There were also headhunter but they were very expensive and for key positions.
<br /><br />
Today it <span style="font-weight: bold;">seems</span> to be the same. But now the game is different. Seth was telling it to the employers, but it could be aplied to the employees.
<br /><br />
And it's different because you create your own reputation, without being unfaithful to your current employer. Not only by building a network in Linkedin. But also for answering questions in a forum, or for writing posts in a blog like this.
<br /><br />
In fact, sometimes you're being paid (in a way) for building that reputation. I love this post: <a href="http://google.dirson.com/post/3076-cuanto-pagarias-matt-cutts/">How much will you pay for Matt Cuts?</a>.
<br /><br />
I know that many companies explore our online profiles. And I think that as employees we should be concious of our profiles, whether or not we're looking for a new job. But I don't think that is dishonest or unfaithful. Of course I do write this blog and I have a relatevely updated Linkedin profile.
<br /><br />
Maybe I've read too much about <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.marcapropia.net/blog.html%E2%80%9D">personal branding</a>. But it seems to me that Internet is starting to balance the relationship between employees and companies.
