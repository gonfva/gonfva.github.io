A few days ago I went to a meeting and we were discussing (among lots of different topics) various optimizing mechanisms for a web application.
<br /><br />
After the meeting had ended, I came to the conclusion that, implicit in all the conversation, I was not fully aware of the most obvious step previous to any optimization:
<br /><br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Measure </span></b></div><br />You cannot optimize if you don't know what do you need to optimize. Is it a database problem? A web problem?
<br /><br />
The guy interviewing had tried to push me further. &nbsp;What to measure? Memory, CPU and request time I vaguely remember replying. What tools to use? At that point I probably screwed up the meeting, but that worth a post on its own.
<br /><br />
I was thinking along these terms while preparing for a different interview. And I suddenly realized that "what to measure" is also important and the answer I provided can be valid but is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measurement">not the only one</a>. Yes, I knew it from <a href="https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course01/unit?unit=2&amp;lesson=4">courses</a>. But now I've learnt it.
<br /><br />
Good thing about selection processes is that you learn a lot from the processes themselves.
