<br />A few weeks ago, I bid and won a <a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pedge/en/2650_specs.pdf">PowerEdge 2650</a>&nbsp;server for three quids (plus another 6 of renting a car and collecting it).
<br /><br />
It´s an old piece of hardware (32 bits double Xeon, 4gb of RAM), bulky as hell (or so does my back says) and noisy as a diesel generator.
<br /><br />
When I came home, my daughters said that couldn't be a computer as it didn't have input/output devices like a keyboard or a monitor. I didn't bother to explain a server does not need a screen or a keyboard. Whether that's correct is arguable. They are learning Computer Science at school, and I only interfere when I see a big mistake.
<br /><br />
Anyway, bringing home the computer was only part of the project. Hey, I'm a geek, but having a server on the floor of my dining room is not where the fun lies even if my wife allows it. First, I needed to open its case, take a look at the the inside (a bit insane, yes I know).
<br /><br />
Then, I needed to install the operating system. I thought that was going to be easy. I install different operating systems all the time. But...
<br /><br />
... I usually install using an USB drive and the server would refuse to boot up from the USB drive.
<br /><br />
OK. It has CD-reader but ...
<br /><br />
... I don´t have a CD-Writer. Who writes CDs anyway?
<br /><br />
Already thinking how/where to record a CD, I decided to investigate something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a>. PXE tends to appear in many BIOS as install from the network. In very general terms, the BIOS is enough to look for a DHCP server that looks for sort of FTP server, that provides a typical file that allows to install an Operating System.
<br /><br />
Unfortunately, I only had a Windows machine available (having two daughters in secondary school, Linux has been unfortunately relegated)
<br /><br />
But there is an <a href="http://hugi.to/blog/archive/2006/12/23/ubuntu-pxe-install-via-windows">old post</a> that explain how to install Ubuntu from windows. The only tweak was the needed to get some current image. You need to get the image from this <a href="ftp://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/trusty/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/netboot.tar.gz">URL</a>
<br /><br />
One small tweak while installing is something that had already happened while installing a server at work. The screen would go blank with the message "Cannot display this video mode". A quick search, and one of the first results was <a href="http://www.jonwitts.co.uk/archives/208">what I needed</a>.
<br /><br />
Once I installed the basic server, I only installed SSH server. The rest of the server was going to be installed using <a href="http://www.ansible.com/home">Ansible</a>. Another topic for another time
<br /><br />
I´m a geek.

And, my wife doesn't read my blog and she is a saint.
