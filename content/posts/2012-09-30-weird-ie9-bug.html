This last two weeks I have dealt with a weird bug in IE9.
<br /><br />
<ul><li>The problem appeared in a legacy web application.&nbsp;</li><li>The issue reported by the user was a combo that didn't drop down.&nbsp;</li><li>The problem appeared in different pages, but only for some combination of values.</li><li>The issue appeared after installing IE9 from IE7 in a Windows Vista.&nbsp;</li><li>The user could reproduce the issue (for a certain combination of values).</li><li>We (both devs and ops) couldn't reproduce in a standard machine&nbsp;even tough&nbsp;at work final users deal with a very standard machine (machine setups are pretty standarized at work).&nbsp;</li><li>When we finally were able to reproduce in a standard machine, it only failed the first time a user logged in (second time, or even IE close rendered the bug irreproducible).</li><li>We&nbsp;finally&nbsp;were able to pinpoint the problem to a very large option (as in 400 characters).</li><li>And now I've been able to reproduce it with a reduced version of the page even in my setup (Vista64+IE9). See the gist. Save to a file, launch it with IE9 and try to change the option. </li></ul><br />We trimmed down to 200 chars (I guess even 150 chars wouldn't be viewable).
<br /><br />
UPDATE (2012-09-30): Tested on IE10 in Windows8 and seems to work fine.
